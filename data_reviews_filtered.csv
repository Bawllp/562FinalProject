0,False,Boosted Residual Networks,"The authors mention that they are not aiming to have SOTA results.
However, that an ensemble of resnets has lower performance than some of single network results, indicates that further experimentation preferably on larger datasets is necessary.

1,False,Boosted Residual Networks,"This paper proposes a boosting based ensemble procedure for residual networks by adopting the Deep Incremental Boosting method that was used for CNN's(Mosca & Magoulas, 2016a). At each step t, a new block of layers are added to the network at a position p_t and the weights of all layers are copied to the current network to speed up training.

The method is not sufficiently novel since the steps of Deep Incremental Boosting are slightly adopted. Instead of adding a layer to the end of the network, this version adds a block of layers to a position p_t (starts at a selected position p_0) and merges layer accordingly hence slightly adopts DIB. 

The empirical analysis does not use any data-augmentation. It is not clear whether the improvements (if there is) of the ensemble disappear after data-augmentation.  Also, one of the main baselines, DIB has no-skip connections therefore this can negatively affect the fair comparison. The authors argue that they did not involve state of art Res Nets since their analysis focuses on the ensemble approach, however any potential improvement of the ensemble can be compensated with an inherent feature of Res Net variant. The boosting procedure can be computationally restrictive in case of ImageNet training and Res Net variants may perform much better in that case too. Therefore the baselines should include the state of art Res Nets and Dense Convolutional networks hence current results are preliminary.

In addition, it is not clear how sensitive the boosting to the selection of injection point.

This paper adopts DIB to Res Nets and provides some empirical analysis however the contribution is not sufficiently novel and the empirical results are not satisfactory for demonstrating that the method is significant.

2,False,Boosted Residual Networks,"The paper under consideration proposes a set of procedures for incrementally expanding a residual network by adding layers via a boosting criterion.

The main barrier to publication is the weak empirical validation. The tasks considered are quite small scale in 2016 (and MNIST with a convolutional net is basically an uninteresting test by this point). The paper doesn't compare to the literature, and CIFAR-10 results fail to improve upon rather simple, single-network published baselines (Springenberg et al, 2015 for example, obtains 92% without data augmentation) and I'm pretty sure there's a simple ResNet result somewhere that outshines these too. The CIFAR100 results are a little bit interesting as they are better than I'm used to seeing (I haven't done a recent literature crawl), and this is unsurprising -- you'd expect ensembles to do well when there's a dearth of labeled training data, and here there are only a few hundred per label. But then it's typical on both CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 to use simple data augmentation schemes which aren't employed here, and these and other forms of regularization are a simpler alternative to a complicated iterative augmentation scheme like this.

It'd be easier to sell this method either as an option for scarce labeled datasets where data augmentation is non-trivial (but then for most image-related applications, random crops and reflections are easy and valid), but that would necessitate different benchmarks, and comparison against simpler methods like said data augmentation, dropout (especially, due to the ensemble interpretation), and so on.",,3.0,5.0

The reason my score is 7 and not higher is because they do not provide comparison to the main alternative of their method -- someone could create a new TensorFlow graph for each dynamic batch.

The presented idea is novel and the results clearly indicate the potential of the approach. For the sake of clarity of the presentation I would drop parts of Section 3 (""A combinator library for neural networks"") which presents technical details that are in general interesting, but do not help the understanding of the core idea of the paper. The presented experimental results on the ""Stanford Sentiment Treebank"" are in my opinion not supporting the claim of the paper, which is towards speed, than a little bit confusing. It is important to point out that even though the presented ensemble ""[...] variant sets a new state-of-the-art on both subtasks"" [p. 8], this is not due to the framework, not even due to the model (comp. lines 4 and 2 of Tab. 2), but probably, and this can only be speculated about, due to the ensemble averaging.

7,True,LR-GAN: Layered Recursive Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation,"The authors propose a method that generates naturally looking images by first generating the background and then conditioned on the previous layer one or multiple foreground objects. Additionally they add a image transformer layer that allows the model to more easily model different appearances.

I would like to see some discussion about the choice of foreground+mask rather than just predicting foreground directly. For MNIST, for example the foreground seems completely irrelevant. For CUB and CIFAR of course the fg adds the texture and color while the masks ensures a crisp boundary. 
- Is the mask a binary mask or a alpha blending mask?
- I find the fact that the model learns to decompose images this nicely and learns to produce crisp foreground masks w/o too much spurious elements (though there are some in CIFAR) pretty fascinating.

The proposed evaluation metric makes sense and seems reasonable. However, AFAICT, theoretically it would be possible to get a high score even though the GAN produces images not recognizable to humans, but only to the classifier network that produces P_g. E.g. if the Generator encodes the class in some subtle way (though this shouldn't happen given the training with an adversarial network).

Fig 3 shows indeed nicely that the decomposition is much nicer when spatial transformers are used. However, it also seems to indicate that the foreground prediction and the foreground mask are largely redundant. For the final results the ""niceness"" of the decomposition appears to be largely irrelevant.

Furthermore, the transformation layer seems to have a small effect, judging from the transformed masked foreground objects. They are mainly scaled down.

- What is the 3rd & 6th column in Fig 9? It is not clear if the final composed images are really as bad as ""advertised"".

Regarding the eval experiment using AMT it is not clear why it is better to provide the users with L2 minimized NN matches rather than random pairs.

I assume that Tab 1 Adversarial Divergence for Real images was not actually evaluated? It would be interesting to see how close to 0 multiple differently initialized networks actually are.

How would the proposed method deal with such situations?

9,True,LR-GAN: Layered Recursive Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation,"The paper proposes a model for image generation where the back-ground is generated first and then the foreground is pasted in by generating first a foregound mask and corresponding appearance, curving the appearance image using the mask and transforming the mask using predicted affine transform to paste it on top of the image. Using AMTurkers the authors verify their generated images are selected 68% of the time as being more naturally looking than corresponding images from a DC-GAN model that does not use a figure-ground aware image generator.

The segmentations masks learn to depict objects in very constrained datasets (birds) only, thus the method appears limited for general shape datasets, as the authors also argue in the paper. Yet, the architectural contributions have potential merit.

11,False,Compositional Kernel Machines,"This paper proposes a new learning framework called ""compositional kernel machines"" (CKM). It combines two ideas: kernel methods and sum-product network (SPN). CKM first defines leaf kernels on elements of the query and training examples, then it defines kernel recursively (similar to sum-product network). This paper has shown that the evaluation CKM can be done efficiently using the same tricks in SPN.

Positive: I think the idea in this paper is interesting. Instance-based learning methods (such as SVM with kernels) have been successful in the past, but have been replaced by deep learning methods (e.g. convnet) in the past few years. This paper investigate an unexplored area of how to combine the ideas from kernel methods and deep networks (SPN in this case). 

Negative: Although the idea of this paper is interesting, this paper is clearly very preliminary. In its current form, I simply do not see any advantage of the proposed framework over convnet. I will elaborate below.

1) One of the most important claims of this paper is that CKM is faster to learn than convnet. I am not clear why that is the case. Both CKM and convnet use gradient descent during learning, why would CKM be faster?

Also during inference, the running time of convnet only depends on its network structure. But for CKM, in addition to the network structure, it also depends on the size of training set. From this perspective, it does not seem CKM is very scalable when the training size is big. That is probably why this paper has to use all kinds of specialized data structures and tricks (even on a fairly simple dataset like NORB)

2) I am having a hard time understanding what the leaf kernel is capturing. For example, if the ""elements"" correspond to raw pixel intensities, a leaf kernel essentially compares the intensity value of a pixel in the query image with that in a training image. But in this case, wouldn't you end up comparing a lot of background pixels across these two images (which does not help with recognition)?

I think it probably helps to explain Sec 3.1 a bit better. In its current form, this part is very dense and hard to understand.

3) It is also not entirely clear to me how you would design the architecture of the sum-product function. The example is Sec 3.1 seems to be fairly arbitrary.

4) The experiment section is probably the weakest part. NORB is a very small and toy-ish dataset by today's standard. Even on this small dataset, the proposed method is only slighly better than SVM (it is not clear whether ""SVM"" in Table 2 is linear SVM or kernel SVM. If it is linear SVM, I suspect the performance of ""SVM"" will be even higher when you use kernel SVM), and far worse than convnet. The proposed method only shows improvement over convnet on synthetic datasets (NORB compositions, NORM symmetries)

Overall, I think this paper has some interesting ideas. But in its current form, it is a bit too preliminary and more work is needed to show its advantage. Having said that, I acknowledge that in the machine learning history, many important ideas seem pre-mature when they were first proposed, and it took time for these ideas to develop.",,5.0,4.0
12,False,Compositional Kernel Machines,"This paper proposes a new learning model ""Compositional Kernel Machines (CKMs)"" that extends the classic kernel machines by constructing compositional kernel functions using sum-product networks. This paper considers the convnets as nicely learned nonlinear decision functions and resort their success in classification to their compositional nature. This perspective motivates the design of compositional kernel functions and the sum-product implementation is indeed interesting. I agree the composition is important for convnets, but it is not the whole story of convnets' success. One essential difference between convnets and CKMs is that all the kernels in convnets are learned directly from data while CKMs still build on top of feature descriptors. This, I believe, limits the representation power of CKMs. A recent paper ""Deep Convolutional Networks are Hierarchical Kernel Machines"" by Anselmi, F. et al. seems to be interesting to the authors.
Experiments seem to be preliminary in this paper. It's good to see promising results of CKMs on small NORB, but it is quite important to show competitive results on recent classification standard benchmarks, such as MNIST, CIFAR10/100 and even Imagenet, in order to establish a novel learning model. In NORB compositions, CKMs seem to be better than convnets at classifying images by their dominant objects. I suspect it is because the use of sparse ORB features. It will be great if this paper could show the accuracy of ORB features with matching kernel SVMs. Some details about this experiment need further clarification, such as what are the high and low probabilities of sampling from each collections and how many images are generated. In NORB Symmetries, CKMs show better performance than convnets with small data, but the convnets seem not converged yet. Could it be possible to show results with larger dataset?",,5.0,3.0
13,False,Compositional Kernel Machines,"The authors propose a method to efficiently augment an SVM variant with many virtual instances, and show promising preliminary results. The paper was an interesting read, with thoughtful methodology, but has partially unsupported and potentially misleading claims.

Pros:
- Thoughtful methodology with sensible design choices
- Potentially useful for smaller (n < 10000) datasets with a lot of statistical structure
- Nice connections with sum-product literature

Cons:
- Claims about scalability are very unclear
- Generally the paper does not succeed in telling a complete story about the properties and applicability of the proposed method.
- Experiments are very preliminary 

The scalability claims are particularly unclear. The paper repeatedly mentions lack of scalability as a drawback for convnets, but it appears the proposed CKM is less scalable than a standard SVM, yet SVMs often handle much fewer training instances than deep neural networks. It appears the scalability advantages are mostly for training sets with roughly fewer than 10,000 instances -- and even if the method could scale to >> 10,000 training instances, it's unclear whether the predictive accuracy would be competitive with convnets in that domain. Moreover, the idea of doing 10^6 operations simply for creating virtual instances on 10^4 training points and 100 test points is still somewhat daunting. What if we had 10^6 training instances and 10^5 testing instances?  Because scalability (in the number of training instances) is one of the biggest drawbacks of using SVMs (e.g. with Gaussian kernels) on modern datasets, the scalability claims in this paper need to be significantly expanded and clarified. On a related note, the suggestion that convnets grow quadratically in computation with additional training instances in the introduction needs to be augmented with more detail, and is potentially misleading. Convnets typically scale linearly with additional training data. 

In general, the paper suffers greatly from a lack of clarity and issues of presentation. As above, the full story is not presented, with critical details often missing. Moreover, it would strengthen the paper to remove broad claims such as ""Just as support vector machines (SVMs) eclipsed multilayer perceptrons in the 1990s, CKMs could become a compelling alternative to convnets with reduced training time and sample complexity"", suggesting that CKMs could eclipse convolutional neural networks, and instead provide more helpful and precise information. Convnets are multilayer perceptrons used in the 1990s (as well as now) and they are not eclipsed by SVMs -- they have different relative advantages. And based on the information presented, broadly advertising scalability over convnets is misleading. Can CKMs scale to datasets with millions of training and test instances?  It seems as if the scalability advantages are limited to smaller datasets, and asymptotic scalability could be much worse in general. And even if CKMs could scale to such datasets would they have as good predictive accuracy as convnets on those applications? Being specific and with full disclosure about the precise strengths and limitations of the work would greatly improve this paper.

CKMs may be more robust to adversarial examples than standard convnets, due to the virtual instances. But there are many approaches to make deep nets more robust to adversarial examples. It would be useful to consider and compare to these. The ideas behind CKMs also are not inherently specific to kernel methods. Have you considered looking at using virtual instances in a similar way with deep networks? A full exploration might be its own paper, but the idea is worth at least brief discussion in the text. 

A big advantage of SVMs (with Gaussian kernels) over deep neural nets is that one can achieve quite good performance with very little human intervention (design choices). However, CKMs seem to require extensive intervention, in terms of architecture (as with a neural network), and in insuring that the virtual instances are created in a plausible manner for the particular application at hand. It's very unclear in general how one would want to create sensible virtual instances and this topic deserves further consideration. Moreover, unlike SVMs (with for example Gaussian or linear kernels) or standard convolutional networks, which are quite general models, CKMs as applied in this paper seem more like SVMs (or kernel methods) which have been highly tailored to a particular application -- in this case, the NORB dataset. There is certainly nothing wrong with the tailored approach, but it would help to be clear and detailed about where the presented ideas can be applied out of the box, or how one would go about making the relevant design choices for a range of different problems. And indeed, it would be good to avoid the potentially misleading suggestions early in the paper that the proposed method is a general alternative to convnets.

The experiments give some insights into the advantages of the proposed approach, but are very limited. To get a sense of the properties --the strengths and limitations -- of the proposed method, one needs a greater range of datasets with a much larger range of training and test sizes. The comparisons are also quite limited: why not an SVM with a Gaussian kernel?  What about an SVM using convnet features from the dataset at hand (light blue curve in figure 3) -- it should do at least as well as the light blue curve. There are also other works that could be considered which combine some of the advantages of kernel methods with deep networks. Also the claim that the approach helps with the curse of dimensionality is sensible but not particularly explored. It also seems the curse of dimensionality could affect the scalability of creating a useful set of virtual instances. And it's unclear how CKM would work without any ORB features. 

Even if the method can (be adapted to) scale to n >> 10000, it's unclear whether it will be more useful than convnets in that domain. Indeed, in the experiments here, convnets essentially match CKMs in performance after 12,000 examples, and would probably perform better than CKMs on larger datasets.  We can only speculate because the experiments don't consider larger problems.

The methodology largely takes inspiration from sum product networks, but its application in the context of a kernel approach is reasonably original, and worthy of exploration. It's reasonable to expect the approach to be significant, but its significance is not demonstrated.

The quality is high in the sense that the methods and insights are thoughtful, but suffers from broad claims and a lack of full and precise detail.

In short: I like the paper, but it needs more specific details, and a full disclosure of where the method should be most applicable, and its precise advantages and limitations.  Code would be helpful for reproducibility.",,5.0,4.0
14,False,Compositional Kernel Machines,"Thank you for an interesting read. The ideas presented have a good basis of being true, but the experiments are rather too simple. It would be interesting to see more empirical evidence.

Pros
- The approach seems to decrease the training time, which is of prime importance in deep learning. Although, that comes at a price of slightly more complex model.
- There is a grounded theory for sum-product functions which is basis for the compositional architecture described in the paper. Theoretically, any semiring and kernel could be used for the model which decreases need for handcrafting the structure of the model, which is a big problem in existing convolutional neural networks.

Cons
- The experiments are on very simple dataset NORB. Although, it is great to understand a model's dynamics on a simpler dataset, some analysis on complex datasets are important to act as empirical evidence. The compositional kernel approach is compared to convolutional neural networks, hence it is only fair to compare said results on large datasets such as Imagenet.

15,False,Nonparametrically Learning Activation Functions in Deep Neural Nets,"This paper describes an approach to learning the non-linear activation function in deep neural nets.  This is achieved by representing the activation function in a basis of non-linear functions and learning the coefficients.  Authors use Fourier basis in the paper.  A theoretical analysis of the proposed approach is also presented, using algorithmic stability arguments, to demonstrate good generalization behavior (vanishing generalization error with large data sets) of networks with learnt non-linearities.

The main question I have about this paper is that writing a non-linear activation function as a linear or affine combination of other non-linear basis functions is equivalent to making a larger network whose nodes have the basis functions as non-linearities and whose weights have certain constraints on them.  Thus, the value of the proposed approach of learning non-linearities over optimizing network capacity for a given task (with fixed non-linearities) is not clear to me.  Or could it be argued that the constrained implied by learnt non-linearity approach are somehow good thing to do?

Another question - In the two stage training process for CNNs, when ReLU activation is replaced by NPFC(L,T), is the NPFC(L,T) activation initialized to approximate ReLU, or is it initialized using random coefficients?

- If all weights are tied across units and layers. One question that would be interesting to study , if there is an optimal non linearity. 

- How different is the non linearity learned if the hidden units are normalized or un-normalized.  In other words how does the non linearity change if you use or don't use batch normalization?

18,False,Training Group Orthogonal Neural Networks with Privileged Information,"The starting point of this work is the understanding that by having decorrelated neurons (e.g. neurons that only fire on background, or only on foreground regions) one provides independent pieces of information to the subsequent decisions. As such one gives ""complementary viewpoints"" of the input to the subsequent layers, which can be thought of as performing ensembling/expert combination within the model, rather than using an ensemble of networks. 

For this, the authors propose a sensible method to decorrelate the activations of intermediate neurons, with the aim of delivering complementary inputs to the final classification layers: they split intermediate neurons to a ""foreground"" and a ""background"" subset, and append side-losses that force them to be zero on background and foreground pixels respectively. 

They demonstrate that this can improve classification on a mid-scale classification example (a fraction of imagenet, and a ResNet with 18, rather than 150 layers), when compared to a ""vanilla"" baseline that does not use these losses.

I enjoyed reading the paper because the idea is simple, smart, and seems to be effective.

20,False,Training Group Orthogonal Neural Networks with Privileged Information,"This paper proposes to learn groups of orthogonal features in a convnet by penalizing correlation among features in each group.  The technique is applied in the setting of image classification with “privileged information” in the form of foreground segmentation masks, where the model is trained to learn orthogonal groups of foreground and background features using the correlation penalty and an additional “background suppression” term.


Pros:

Proposes a “group-wise model diversity” loss term which is novel, to my knowledge.

The use of foreground segmentation masks to improve image classification is also novel.

The method is evaluated on two standard and relatively large-scale vision datasets: ImageNet and PASCAL VOC 2012.


Cons:

The evaluation is lacking.  There should be a baseline that leaves out the background suppression term, so readers know how much that term is contributing to the performance vs. the group orthogonal term.  The use of the background suppression term is also confusing to me -- it seems redundant, as the group orthogonality term should already serve to suppress the use of background features by the foreground feature extractor.

It would be nice to see the results with “Incomplete Privileged Information” on the full ImageNet dataset (rather than just 10% of it) with the privileged information included for the 10% of images where it’s available.  This would verify that the method and use of segmentation masks remains useful even in the regime of more labeled classification data.

The presentation overall is a bit confusing and difficult to follow, for me.  For example, Section 4.2 is titled “A Unified Architecture: GoCNN”, yet it is not an overview of the method as a whole, but a list of specific implementation details (even the very first sentence).

Minor: calling eq 3 a “regression loss” and writing “||0 - x||” rather than just “||x||” is not necessary and makes understanding more difficult -- I’ve never seen a norm regularization term written this way or described as a “regression to 0”.

Minor: in fig. 1 I think the FG and BG suppression labels are swapped: e.g., the “suppress foreground” mask has 1s in the FG and 0s in the BG (which would suppress the BG, not the FG).


An additional question: why are the results in Table 4 with 100% privileged information different from those in Table 1-2?  Are these not the same setting?

The ideas presented in this paper are novel and show some promise, but are currently not sufficiently ablated for readers to understand what aspects of the method are important.  Besides additional experiments, the paper could also use some reorganization and revision for clarity.

Edit (1/29/17): after considering the latest revisions -- particularly the full ImageNet evaluation results reported in Table 5 demonstrating that the background segmentation 'privileged information' is beneficial even with the full labeled ImageNet dataset -- I've upgraded my rating from 4 to 6.

(I'll reiterate a very minor point about Figure 1 though: I still think the ""0"" and ""1"" labels in the top part of the figures should be swapped to match the other labels.  e.g., the topmost path in figure 1a, with the text ""suppress foreground"", currently has 0 in the background and 1 in the foreground, when one would want the reverse of this to suppress the foreground.)",,6.0,4.0
21,False,Training Group Orthogonal Neural Networks with Privileged Information,"This paper proposes a modification to ConvNet training so that the feature activations before the linear classifier are divided into groups such that all pairs of features across all pairs of groups are encouraged to have low statistical correlation. Instead of discovering the groups automatically, the work proposes to use supervision, which they call privileged information, to assign features to groups in a hand-coded fashion. The developed method is applied to image classification.

Pros:
- The paper is clear and easy to follow
- The experimental results seem to show some benefit from the proposed approach

Cons:
(1) The paper proposes one core idea (group orthogonality w/ privileged information), but then introduces background feature suppression without much motivation and without careful experimentation

This paper is promising and I would be willing to accept an improved version. However, the current version lacks focus and clean experiments.

The hope is that such a model will have the same boost in accuracy, while requiring fewer FLOPs and less memory. Based on this introduction, I expect the rest of the paper to focus on this point. But it does not; there are no experimental results on ensembles and no experimental evidence that the proposed approach in able to avoid the speed and memory cost of ensembles while also retaining the accuracy benefit.

Second, the technical contribution of the paper is presented as group orthogonality (GO). However, in Sec 4.1 the idea of background feature suppression is introduced. While some motivation for it is given, the motivation does not tie into GO. GO does not require bg suppression and the introduction of it seems ad hoc. Moreover, the experiments never decouple GO and bg suppression, so we are unable to understand how GO works on its own. This is a critical experimental flaw in my reading.

22,True,Highway and Residual Networks learn Unrolled Iterative Estimation,"This paper provides a new perspective to understanding the ResNet and Highway net. The new perspective assumes that the blocks inside the networks with residual or skip-connection are groups of successive layers with the same hidden size, which performs to iteratively refine their estimates of the same feature instead of generate new representations. Under this perspective, some contradictories with the traditional representation view induced by ResNet and Highway network and other paper can be well explained.

The pros of the paper are:
1. A novel perspective to understand the recent progress of neural network is proposed.
2. The paper provides a quantitatively experimentals to compare ResNet and Highway net, and shows contradict results with several claims from previous work. The authors also give discussions and explanations about the contradictories, which provides a good insight of the disadvantages and advantages between these two kind of networks.

The main cons of the paper is that the experiments are not sufficient. For example, since the main contribution of the paper is to propose the “unrolled iterative estimation"" and the stage 4 of Figure 3 seems not follow the assumption of ""unrolled iterative estimation"" and the authors says: ""We note that stage four (with three blocks) appears to be underestimating the representation values, indicating a probable weak link in the architecture."". Thus, it would be much better to do experiments to show that under some condition, the performance of stage 4 can follow the assumption.

25,False,Multi-label learning with semantic embeddings,"This paper proposes SEM, a simple large-size multilabel learning algorithm which models the probability of each label as softmax(sigmoid(W^T X) + b), so a one-layer hidden network. This in and of itself is not novel, nor is the idea of optimizing this by adagrad. Though it's weird that the paper explicitly derives the gradient and suggests doing alternating adagrad steps instead of the more standard adagrad steps; it's unclear whether this matters at all for performance. The main trick responsible for increasing the efficiency of this model is the candidate label sampling, which is done in a relatively standard way by sampling labels proportionally to their frequency in the dataset.

Given that neither the model nor the training strategy is novel, it's surprising that the results are better than the state-of-the-art in quality and efficiency (though non-asymptotic efficiency claims are always questionable since implementation effort trades off fairly well against performance).

28,False,Unsupervised Perceptual Rewards for Imitation Learning,"The paper explores a simple approach to learning reward functions for reinforcement learning from visual observations of expert trajectories for cases were only little training data is available. To obtain descriptive rewards even under such challenging conditions the method re-uses a pre-trained neural network as feature extractor (this is similar to a large body of work on task transfer with neural nets in the area of computer vision) and represents the reward function as a weighted distance to features for automatically extracted ""key-frames"" of the provided expert trajectories.

The paper is well written and explains all involved concepts clearly while also embedding the presented approach in the literature on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). The resulting algorithm is appealing due to its simplicity and could prove useful for many real world robotic applications. I have three main issues with the paper in its current form, if these can be addressed I believe the paper would be significantly strengthened:
1) Although the recursive splitting approach for extracting the ""key-frames"" seems reasonable and the feature selection is well motivated I am missing two baselines in the experiments:
   - what happens if the feature selection is disabled and the distance between all features is used ? will this immediately break the procedure ? If not, what is the trade-off here ? 
   - an even simpler baseline than what is proposed in the paper would be the following procedure: simply use all frames of the recorded trajectories, calculate the distance to them in feature space and weights them according to their time as in the approach proposed in the paper. How well would that work ?
2) I understand the desire to combine the extracted reward function with a simple RL method but believe the used simple controller could potentially introduce a significant bias in the experiments since it requires initialization from an expert trajectory. As a direct consequence of this initialization the RL procedure is already started close to a good solution and the extracted reward function is potentially only queried in a small region around what was observed in the initial set of images (perhaps with the exception of the human demonstrations). Without an additional experiment it is thus unclear how well the presented approach will work in combination with other RL methods for training the controller.
3) I understand that the low number of available images excludes training a deep neural net directly for the task at hand but one has to wonder how other baselines would do. What happens if one uses a random projection of the images to form a feature vector? How well would a distance measure using raw images (e.g. L2 norm of image differences) or a distance measure based on the first principal components work? It seems that occlusions etc. would exclude them from working well but without empirical evidence it is hard to confirm this.

Minor issues:
- Page 1: ""make use of ideas about imitation"" reads a bit awkwardly
- Page 3: ""We use the Inception network pre-trained ImageNet"" -> pre-trained for ImageNet classification
- Page 4: the definition of the transition function for the stochastic case seems broken
- Page 6: ""efficient enough to evaluate"" a bit strangely written sentence

Additional comments rather than real issues:
- The paper is mainly of empirical nature, little actual learning is performed to obtain the reward function and no theoretical advances are needed. This is not necessarily bad but makes the empirical evaluation all the more important. 
- While I liked the clear exposition the approach -- in the end -- boils down to computing quadratic distances to features of pre-extracted ""key-frames"", it is nice that you make a connection to standard IRL approaches in Section 2.1 but one could argue that this derivation is not strictly necessary.",,6.0,5.0
29,False,Unsupervised Perceptual Rewards for Imitation Learning,"The paper tries to present a first step towards solving the difficult problem of ""learning from limited number of demonstrations"". The paper tries to present 3 contributions towards this effort:
1. unsupervised segmentation of videos to identify intermediate steps in a process
2. define reward function based on feature selection for each sub-task

Pros:
+ The paper is a first attempt to solve a very challenging problem, where a robot is taught real-world tasks with very few visual demonstrations and without further retraining.
+ The method is well motivated and tries to transfer the priors learned from object classification task (through deep network features) to address the problem of limited training examples.
+ As demonstrated in Fig. 3, the reward functions could be more interpretable and correlate with transitions between subtasks.
+ Breaking a video into subtasks helps a video demonstration-based method achieve comparable performance with a method which requires full instrumentation for complex real-world tasks like door opening.

Cons:
1. Unsupervised video segmentation can serve as a good starting point to identify subtasks. However, there are multiple prior works in this domain which need to be referenced and compared with. Particularly, video shot detection and shot segmentation works try to identify abrupt change in video to break it into visually diverse shots. These methods could be easily augmented with CNN-features.
(Note that there are multiple papers in this domain, eg. refer to survey in Yuan et al. Trans. on Circuits and Systems for video tech. 2007)

2. The authors claim that they did not find it necessary to identify commonalities across demonstrations. This limits the scope of the problem drastically and requires the demonstrations to follow very specific set of constraints. Again, it is to be noted that there is past literature (video co-segmentation, eg. Tang et al. ECCV'14) which uses these commonalities to perform unsupervised video segmentation.

3. The unsupervised temporal video segmentation approach in the paper is only compared to a very simple random baseline for a few sample videos. However, given the large amount of literature in this domain, it is difficult to judge the novelty and significance of the proposed approach from these experiments.

4. The authors hypothesize that ""sparse independent features exists which can discriminate a wide range of unseen inputs"" and encode this intuition through the feature selection strategy. Again, the validity of the hypothesis is not experimentally well demonstrated. For instance, comparison to a simple linear classifier for subtasks would have been useful.

Overall, the paper presents a simple approach based on the idea that recognizing sub-goals in an unsupervised fashion would help in learning from few visual demonstrations. This is well motivated as a first-step towards a difficult task. However, the methods and claims presented in the paper need to be analyzed and compared with better baselines.",,4.0,4.0
30,False,Unsupervised Perceptual Rewards for Imitation Learning,"This paper proposes a novel method to learn vision feature as intermediate rewards to guide the robot training in the real world. Since there are only a few sequences of human demonstrations, the paper first segments the sequences into fragments so that the features are roughly invariant on the corresponding fragments across sequences, then clusters and finds most discriminative features on those fragments, and uses them as the reward function. The features are from pre-trained deep models.

The idea is simple and seems quite effective in picking the right reward functions. Fig. 6 is a good comparison (although it could be better with error bars). However, some baselines are not strong, in particular vision related baselines. For example, the random reward (""simply outputs true or false"") in Tbl. 2 seems quite arbitrary and may not serve as a good baseline (but its performance is still not that bad, surprisingly.). A better baseline would be to use random/simpler feature extraction on the image, e.g., binning features and simply picking the most frequent ones, which might not be as discriminative as the proposed feature. I wonder whether a simpler vision-based approach would lead to a similarly performed reward function. If so, then these delicate steps (segment, etc) altogether.  ",,6.0,4.0

My concerns about the paper more or less mirror my pre-review questions. I certainly agree that the learned variable computation mechanism is obviously doing something interesting. The empirical results really need to be grounded with respect to the state of the art, and LSTMs are still an elephant in the room. (Note that I do not consider beating LSTMs, GRUs, or any method in particular as a prerequisite for acceptance, but the comparison nevertheless should be made.)

In pre-review responses the authors brought up that LSTMs perform more computation per timestep than Elman networks, and while that is true, this is an axis along which they can be compared, this factor controlled for (at least in expectation, by varying the number of LSTM cells), etc. A brief discussion of the proposed gating mechanism in light of the currently popular ones would strengthen the presentation.

32,True,Variable Computation in Recurrent Neural Networks,"This paper describes a simple but clever method for allowing variable amounts of computation at each time step in RNNs. The new architecture seems to outperform vanilla RNNs on various sequence modelling tasks. Visualizations of the assignment of computational resources over time support the hypothesis that the model is able to learn to assign more computations whenever longer longer term dependencies need to be taken into account.

The proposed model is evaluated on a multitude of tasks and its ability to outperform similar architectures seems consistent. Some of the tasks allow for an interesting analysis of the amount of computation the model requests at each time step. It’s very interesting to see how the model seems to use more resources at the start of each word or ASCII character. I also like the investigation of the effect of imposing a pattern of computational budget assignment which uses prior knowledge about the task. The superior performance of the architecture is impressive but I’m not yet convinced that the baseline models had an equal number of hyperparameters to tune. I’ll come back to this point in the next paragraph because it’s mainly a clarity issue.

The abstract claims that the model is computationally more efficient than regular RNNs. There are no wall time measurements supporting this claim. While the model is theoretically able to save computations, the points made by the paper are clearly more conceptual and about the ability of the model to choose how to allocate its resources. This makes the paper interesting enough by itself but the claims of computational gains are misleading without actual results to back them up. I also find it unfortunate that it’s not clear from the text how the hyperparameter \bar{m} was chosen. Whether it was chosen randomly or set using a hyperparameter search on held-out data influences the fairness of a comparison with RNNs which did not have a similar type of hyperparameter for controlling regularization like for example dropout or weight noise (even if regularization of RNNs is a bit tricky). I don’t consider this a very serious flaw because I’m impressed enough by the fact that the new architecture achieves roughly similar performance while learning to allocate resources but I do think that details of this type are too important to be absent from the text. Even if the superior performance is due to this extra regularization controlling parameter it can actually be seen as a useful part of the architecture but it would be nice to know how sensitive the model is to its precise value.

To my knowledge, the proposed architecture is novel. The way the amount of computation is determined is unlike other methods for variable computation I have seen and quite inventive. Originality is one of this paper’s strongest points. 

It’s currently hard to predict whether this method for variable computation will be used a lot in practice given that this also depends on how feasible it is to obtain actual computational gains at the hardware level. That said, the architecture may turn out to be useful for learning long-term dependencies. I also think that the interpretability of the value m_t is a nice property of the method and that it’s visualizations are very interesting. It might shed some more light into what makes certain tasks difficult for RNNs. 

Pros:
Original clever idea.
Nice interesting visualizations.
Interesting experiments.

Cons:
Some experimental details are not clear.
I’m not convinced of the strength of the baseline.
The paper shouldn’t claim actual computational savings without reporting wall-clock times.

Edit:
I'm very positively impressed by the way the authors ended up addressing the biggest concerns I had about the paper and raised my score. Adding an LSTM baseline and results with a GRU version of the model significantly improves the empirical quality of the paper. On top of that, the authors addressed my question about some experimental detail I found important and promised to change the wording of the paper to remove confusion about whether the computational savings are conceptual or in actual wall time. I think it's fine that they are conceptual only as long as this is clear from the paper and abstract. I want to make clear to the AC that since the changes to the paper are currently still promises, my new score should be assumed to apply to an updated version of the paper in which the aforementioned concerns have indeed been addressed. 

Edit: 
Since I didn't know that the difference with the SOTA for some of these tasks was so large, I had to lower my score again after learning about this. I still think it's a good paper but with these results I cannot say that it stands out.

34,False,A Simple yet Effective Method to Prune Dense Layers of Neural Networks,"Summary:
In this paper, the authors introduce NoiseOut, a way to reduce parameters by pruning neurons from a network. 
They do this by identifying pairs of neurons produce the most correlated outputs, and replacing the pair by one neuron, and then appropriately adjusting weights.
This technique relies on neurons having high correlations however, so they introduce an additional output neuron -- a noise output, which results in the network trying to predict the mean of the noise distribution.
As this is a constant, it increases correlation between neurons.
Experiments test this out on MNIST and SVHN

Comments:
This is an interesting suggestion on how to prune neurons, but more experiments (on larger datasets) are probably need to be convincing that this is an approach that is guaranteed to work well. 

Equation (5) seems to be very straightforwards?

It seems like that for larger datasets, more noise outputs might have to be added to ensure higher correlations? Is there a downside to this in terms of the overall accuracy?

35,False,A Simple yet Effective Method to Prune Dense Layers of Neural Networks,"The paper proposes to prune a neural network by removing neurons whose operation is highly correlated with other neurons. The idea is nice and somewhat novel - most pruning methods concentrate on removal of individual weights, however I haven't done a through research on this topic. However, the experimental and theoretical justification of this method need to be improved before publication:

1. Experiments. The authors do not report accuracy degradation while pruning in the tables, laconically stating that the networks did not degrade. This is not convincing. The only details are given in Figure 5, however this Figure disagrees with Table 2: in the Table, the number of parameters ranges from 40k-600k, while the Figure pictures the range 12k-24k. Unless more details are provided, simply claiming that a network can remove 50% neurons with no number on the degradation of accuracy is not convincing.

2. Theory. The proofs do not match the experimental conditions and make unreasonable assumptions. The proofs show that in the absence of biases a network with a constant output will have two correlated neurons that generate the output offset. However, this is exactly why networks have biases and doesn't explain why noise injection helps (the proof suggests that all should be fine with deterministic auxiliary neuron). My interpretation is that the noisy output injects gradient noise (see e.g. the concurrent ICLR submission ",,3.0,4.0
36,True,Calibrating Energy-based Generative Adversarial Networks,"The submission explores several alternatives to provide the generator function in generative adversarial training with additional gradient information. The exposition starts by describing a general formulation about how this additional gradient information (termed K(p_gen) could be added to the generative adversarial training objective function (Equation 1). Next, the authors prove that the shape of the optimal discriminator does indeed depend on the added gradient information (Proposition 3.1), which is unsurprising. Finally, the authors propose three particular alternatives to construct K(p_gen): the negative entropy of the generator distribution, the L2 norm of the generator distribution, and a constant function (which resembles the EBGAN objective of Zhao et al, 2016).

The exposition moves then to an experimental evaluation of the method, which sets K(p_gen) to be the approximate entropy of the generator distribution. At this point, my intuition is that the objective function under study is the vanilla GAN objective, plus a regularization term that encourages diversity (high entropy) in the generator distribution. The hope of the authors is that this regularization will transform the discriminator into an estimate of the energy landscape of the data distribution.

The experimental evaluation proceeds by 1) showing the contour plots of the obtained generator distribution for a 2D problem, 2) studying the generation diversity in MNIST digits, and 3) showing some samples for CIFAR-10 and CelebA. The 2D problem results are convincing, since one can clearly observe that the discriminator scores translate into unnormalized values of the density function. The MNIST results offer good intuition also: the more prototypical digits are assigned larger scores (unnormalized densities) by the discriminator, and the less prototypical digits are assigned smaller scores. The sample experiments from Section 5.3 are less convincing, since no samples from baseline models are provided for comparison.

To this end, I would recommend the authors to clarify three aspects. First, we have seen that entropy regularization leads to a discriminator that estimates the energy landscape of the data distribution. But, how does this regularization reshape the generator function? It would be nice to see the mean MNIST digit according to the generator, and some other statistics if possible. Second, how do the samples produced by the proposed methods compare (visually speaking) to the state-of-the art? Third, what are the *shortcomings* of this method versus vanilla GAN? Too much computational overhead? What are the qualitative and quantitative differences between the two entropy estimators proposed in the manuscript?

Overall, a clearly written paper. I vote for acceptance.

As an open question to the authors: What breakthroughs should we pursue to derive a GAN objective where the discriminator is an estimate of the data density function, after training?",,8.0,4.0
37,True,Calibrating Energy-based Generative Adversarial Networks,"This paper addresses one of the major shortcomings of generative adversarial networks - their lack of mechanism for evaluating held-out data. While other work such as BiGANs/ALI address this by learning a separate inference network, here the authors propose to change the GAN objective function such that the optimal discriminator is also an energy function, rather than becoming uninformative at the optimal solution. Training this new objective requires gradients of the entropy of the generated data, which are difficult to approximate, and the authors propose two methods to do so, one based on nearest neighbors and one based on a variational lower bound. The results presented show that on toy data the learned discriminator/energy function closely approximates the log probability of the data, and on more complex data the discriminator give a good measure of quality for held out data.

I would say the largest shortcomings of the paper are practical issues around the scalability of the nearest neighbors approximation and accuracy of the variational approximation, which the authors acknowledge. Also, since entropy estimation and density estimation are such closely linked problems, I wonder if any practical method for EGANs will end up being equivalent to some form of approximate density estimation, exactly the problem GANs were designed to circumvent. Nonetheless, the elegant mathematical exposition alone makes the paper a worthwhile contribution to the literature.

Also, some quibbles about the writing - it seems that something is missing in the sentence at the top of pg. 5 ""Finally, let's whose discriminative power"". I'm not sure what the authors mean to say here. And the title undersells the paper - it makes it sound like they are making a small improvement to training an existing model rather than deriving an alternative training framework.",,8.0,4.0
38,True,Calibrating Energy-based Generative Adversarial Networks,"The authors present a method for changing the objective of generative adversarial networks such that the discriminator accurately recovers density information about the underlying data distribution. In the course of deriving the changed objective they prove that stability of the discriminator is not guaranteed in the standard GAN setup but can be recovered via an additional entropy regularization term.

The paper is clearly written, including the theoretical derivation. The derivation of the additional regularization term seems valid and is well explained. The experiments also empirically seem to support the claim that the proposed changed objective results in a ""better"" discriminator. There are only a few issues with the paper in its current form:
- The presentation albeit fairly clear in the details following the initial exposition in 3.1 and the beginning of 3.2 fails to accurately convey the difference between the energy based view of training GANs and the standard GAN. As a result it took me several passes through the paper to understand why the results don't hold for a standard GAN. I think it would be clearer if you state the connections up-front in 3.1 (perhaps without the additional f-gan perspective) and perhaps add some additional explanation as to how c() is implemented right there or in the experiments (you may want to just add these details in the Appendix, see also comment below).
- The proposed procedure will by construction only result in an improved generator and unless I misunderstand something does not result in improved stability of GAN training. You also don't make such a claim but an uninformed reader might get this wrong impression, especially since you mention improved performance compared to Salimans et al. in the Inception score experiment. It might be worth-while mentioning this early in the paper.
- The experiments, although well designed, mainly convey qualitative results with the exception of the table in the appendix for the toy datasets. I know that evaluating GANs is in itself not an easy task but I wonder whether additional more quantitative experiments could be performed to evaluate the discriminator performance. For example: one could evaluate how well the final discriminator does separate real from fake examples, how robust its classification is to injected noise (e.g. how classification accuracy changes for noised training data). Further one might wonder whether the last layer features learned by a discriminator using the changed objective are better suited for use in auxiliary tasks (e.g. classifying objects into categories).
- Main complaint: It is completely unclear what the generator and discriminators look like for the experiments. You mention that code will be available soon but I feel like a short description at least of the form of the energy used should also appear in the paper somewhere (perhaps in the appendix).

39,True,Calibrating Energy-based Generative Adversarial Networks,"Interesting papers. 
Good explanation using a fair amount of math.

I have some questions. 

1. In the appendix, you compare your algorithm to f-GAN. However, It would be more natural that you compare it with GMMN because the formulation of maximum mean discrepancy is more similar to  (1).

2. You claim that f-GAN including the usual GAN is too restrictive.  Would that statement be applied to GMMN? 
From my understanding, GAN is not restrictive because the discriminator is updated once or twice continuously and the obtained ratio is not optimal. This early stopping is a kind of regularization that prevents the discriminator from overfitting. In reality, GANs work using that stopping rule. However, GMMN would be restrictive because such a stopping rule cannot be used.

The paper is clearly written and is easy to follow.

Novelty is a weak factor in this paper. The main contributions come from (1) applying previous work on NFs to the problem of MaxEnt estimation and (2) addressing some of the optimization issues resulting from stochastic approximations to E[||T||] in combination with the annealing of Lagrange multipliers.
Applying the NFs to MaxEnt is in itself not very novel as a framework. For instance, one could obtain a loss equivalent to the main loss in eq. (6) by minimizing the KLD between KL[p_{\phi};f], where f is the unormalized likelihood f \propto exp \sum_k( - \lambda_k T - c_k ||T_k||^2  ). This type of derivation is typical in all previous works using NFs for variational inference.

44,True,Maximum Entropy Flow Networks,"The authors propose a new approach for estimating maximum entropy distributions
subject to expectation constraints. Their approach is based on using
normalizing flow networks to non-linearly transform samples from a tractable
density function using invertible transformations. This allows access to the
density of the resulting distribution. The parameters of the normalizing flow
network are learned by maximizing a stochastic estimate of the entropy
obtained by sampling and evaluating the log-density on the obtained samples.
This stochastic optimization problem includes constraints on expectations with
respect to samples from the normalizing flow network. These constraints are
approximated in practice by sampling and are therefore stochastic. The
optimization problem is solved by using the augmented Lagrangian method. The
proposed method is validated on a toy problem with a Dirichlet distribution and
on a financial problem involving the estimation of price changes from option
price data.

Quality:

The paper seems to be technically sound. My only concern would the the approach
followed to apply the augmented Lagrangian method when the objective and the
constraints are stochastic. The authors propose their own solution to this
problem, based on a hypothesis test, but I think it is likely that this has
already been addressed before in the literature. It would be good if the
authors could comment on this.

The experiments performed show that the proposed approach can outperform Gibbs
sampling from the exact optimal distribution or at least be equivalent, with
the advantage of having a closed form solution for the density.

I am concern about the difficulty of he problems considered.
The Dirichlet distributions are relatively smooth and the distribution in the
financial problem is one-dimensional (in this case you can use numerical
methods to compute the normalization constant and plot the exact density).
They seem to be very easy and do not show how the method would perform in more
challenging settings: high-dimensions, more complicated non-linear constraints,
etc...

Clarity:

The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.

Originality:

The proposed method is not very original since it is based on applying an
existing technique (normalizing flow networks) to a specific problem: that of
finding a maximum entropy distribution. The methodological contributions are
almost non-existing. One could only mention the combination of the normalizing
flow networks with the augmented Lagrangian method. 

Significance:

The results seem to be significant in the sense that the authors are able to
find densities of maximum entropy distributions, something which did not seem
to be possible before. However, it is not clearly how useful this can be in
practice. The problem that they address with real-world data (financial data)
could have been solved as well by using 1-dimensional quadrature. The authors
should consider more challenging problems which have a clear practical
interest.

45,False,NEWSQA: A MACHINE COMPREHENSION DATASET,"Paper Summary: 
This paper presents a new comprehension dataset called NewsQA dataset, containing 100,000 question-answer pairs from over 10,000 news articles from CNN. The dataset is collected through a four-stage process -- article filtering, question collection, answer collection and answer validation. Examples from the dataset are divided into different types based on answer types and reasoning required to answer questions. Human and machine performances on NewsQA are reported and compared with SQuAD.

Paper Strengths: 
-- I agree that models can benefit from diverse set of datasets. This dataset is collected from news articles, hence might pose different sets of problems from current popular datasets such as SQuAD.
-- The proposed dataset is sufficiently large for data hungry deep learning models to train. 
-- The inclusion of questions with null answers is a nice property to have.
-- A good amount of thought has gone into formulating the four-stage data collection process.
-- The proposed BARB model is performing as good as a published state-of-the-art model, while being much faster.    

Paper Weaknesses: 
-- Human evaluation is weak. Two near-native English speakers' performance on 100 examples each can hardly be a representative of the complete dataset. Also, what is the model performance on these 200 examples?
-- Not that it is necessary for this paper, but to clearly demonstrate that this dataset is harder than SQuAD, the authors should either calculate the human performance the same way as SQuAD or calculate human performances on both NewsQA and SQuAD in some other consistent manner on large enough subsets which are good representatives of the complete datasets. Dataset from other communities such as VQA dataset (Antol et al., ICCV 2015) also use the same method as SQuAD to compute human performance. 
-- Section 3.5 says that 86% of questions have answers agreed upon by atleast 2 workers. Why is this number inconsistent with the 4.5% of questions which have answers without agreement after validation (last line in Section 4.1)?
-- Is the same article shown to multiple Questioners? If yes, is it ensured that the Questioners asking questions about the same article are not asking the same/similar questions?
-- Authors mention that they keep the same hyperparameters as SQuAD. What are the accuracies if the hyperparameters are tuned using a validation set from NewsQA?
-- 500 examples which are labeled for reasoning types do not seem enough to represent the complete dataset. Also, what is the model performance on these 500 examples?
-- Which model's performance has been shown in Figure 1?
-- Are the two ""students"" graduate/undergraduate students or researchers?
-- Test set seems to be very small.
-- Suggestion: Answer validation step is nice, but maybe the dataset can be released in 2 versions -- one with all the answers collected in 3rd stage (without the validation step), and one in the current format with the validation step. 

Preliminary Evaluation: 
The proposed dataset is a large scale machine comprehension dataset collected from news articles, which in my suggestion, is diverse enough from existing datasets that state-of-the-art models can definitely benefit from it. With a better human evaluation, I think this paper will make a good poster.",,6.0,4.0
46,False,NEWSQA: A MACHINE COMPREHENSION DATASET,"It would seem that the shelf life of a dataset has decreased rapidly in recent literature. SQuAD dataset has been heavily pursued as soon as it hit online couple months ago, the best performance on their leaderboard now reaching to 82%. This is rather surprising when taking into account the fact that the formal conference presentation of the dataset took place only a month ago at EMNLP’16, and that the reported machine performance (at the time of paper submission) was only at 51%. One reasonable speculation is that the dataset may have not been hard enough.

NewsQA, the paper in submission, aims to address this concern by presenting a dataset of a comparable scale created through different QA collection strategies. Most notably, the authors solicit questions without requiring answers from the same turkers, in order to promote more diverse and hard-to-answer questions. Another notable difference is that the questions are gathered without showing the content of the news articles, and the dataset makes use of a bigger subset of CNN/Daily corpus (12K / 90K), as opposed to a much smaller subset (500 / 90K) used by SQuAD.

In sum, I think NewsQA dataset presents an effort to construct a harder, large-scale reading comprehension challenge, a recently hot research topic for which we don’t yet have satisfying datasets. While not without its own weaknesses, I think this dataset presents potential values compared to what are available out there today.

That said, the paper does read like it was prepared in a hurry, as there are numerous small things that the authors could have done better. As a result, I do wonder about the quality of the dataset. For one, human performance of SQuAD measured by the authors (70.5 - 82%) is lower than that reported by SQuAD (80.3 - 90.5%). I think this sort of difference can easily happen depending on the level of carefulness the annotators can maintain. After all, not all humans have the same level of carefulness or even the same level of reading comprehension. I think it’d be the best if the authors can try to explain the reason behind these differences, and if possible, perform a more careful measurement of human performance. If anything, I don’t think it looks favorable for NewsQA if the human performance is only at the level of 74.9%, as it looks as if the difficulty of the dataset comes mainly from the potential noise from the QA collection process, which implies that the low model performance could result from not necessarily because of the difficulty of the comprehension and reasoning, but because of incorrect answers given by human annotators.

I’m also not sure whether the design choice of not presenting the news article when soliciting the questions was a good one. I can imagine that people might end up asking similar generic questions when not enough context has been presented. Perhaps taking a hybrid, what I would like to suggest is to present news articles where some sentences or phrases are randomly redacted, so that the question generators can have a bit more context while not having the full material in front of them.

Yet another way of encouraging the turkers from asking too trivial questions is to engage an automatic QA system on the fly — turkers must construct a QA pair for which an existing state-of-the-art system cannot answer correctly.

47,False,NEWSQA: A MACHINE COMPREHENSION DATASET,"Summary: The paper proposes a novel machine comprehension dataset called NEWSQA. The dataset consists of over 100,000 question answer pairs based on over 10,000 news articles from CNN. The paper analyzes the different types of answers and the different types of reasoning required to answer questions in the dataset. The paper evaluates human performance and the performance of two baselines on the dataset and compares them with the performance on SQuAD dataset. 

Strengths:

1. The paper presents a large scale dataset for machine comprehension. 

2. The question collection method seems reasonable to collect exploratory questions. Having an answer validation step is desirable.

3. The paper proposes a novel (computationally more efficient) implementation of the match-LSTM model.

Weaknesses:

1. The human evaluation presented in the paper is not satisfactory because the human performance is reported on a very small subset (200 questions). So, it seems unlikely that these 200 questions will provide a reliable measure of the human performance on the entire dataset (which consists of thousands of questions).

2. NEWSQA dataset is very similar to SQuAD dataset in terms of the size of the dataset, the type of dataset -- natural language questions posed by crowdworkers, answers comprising of spans of text from related paragraphs. The paper presents two empirical ways to show that NEWSQA is more challenging than SQuAD -- 1) the gap between human and machine performance in NEWSQA is larger than that in SQuAD. However, since the human performance numbers are reported on very small subset, these trends might not carry over when human performance is computed on all of the dataset.
2) the sentence-level accuracy on SQuAD is higher than that in NEWSQA. However, as the paper mentions, the differences in accuracies could likely be due to different lengths of documents in the two datasets. So, even this measure does not truly reflect that SQuAD is less challenging than NEWSQA.
So, it is not clear if NEWSQA is truly more challenging than SQuAD.

3. Authors mention that BARB is computationally more efficient and faster compared to match-LSTM. However, the paper does not report how much faster BARB is compared to match-LSTM.

4. On page 7, under ""Boundary pointing"" paragraph, the paper should clarify what ""s"" in ""n_s"" refers to.

Review summary: While the dataset collection method seems interesting and promising, I would be more convinced after I see the following --
1. Human performance on all (or significant percentage of the dataset).
2. An empirical study that fairly shows that NEWSQA is more challenging (or better in some other way) than SQuAD.",,6.0,3.0
48,True,Learning to Act by Predicting the Future,"The paper presents an on-policy method to predict future intrinsic measurements. All the experiments are performed in the game of Doom (vizDoom to be exact), and instead of just predicting win/loss or the number of frags (score), the authors trained their model to predict (a sequence of) triplets of (health, ammunition, frags), weighted by (a sequence of) ""goal"" triplets that they provided as input. Changing the weights of the goal triplet is a way to perform/guide exploration. At test time, one can act by maximizing the long term goal only.

The results are impressive, as this model won the 2016 vizDoom competition. The experimental section of the paper seems sound:
 - There are comparisons of DFP with A3C, DQN, and an attempt to compare with DSR (a recent similar approach from Kulkarni et al., 2016). DFP outperforms other approaches (or equal them when they reach a ceiling / optimum, as for A3C in scenario D1).
 - There is an ablation study that supports the thesis that all the ""added complexity"" of the paper's model is useful.

Predicting intrinsic motivation (Singh et al. 2004), auxiliary variables, and forward modelling, are well-studied domains of reinforcement learning. The version that I read (December 4th revision) adequately references prior work, even if it is not completely exhaustive. 

A few comments (nitpicks) on the form:
 - Doom is described as a 3D environment, whereas it is actually a 2D environment (the height is not a discriminative/actionable dimension) presented in (fake) 3D.
 - The use of ""P"" in (2) (and subsequently) may be misleading as it stands for prediction but not probability (as is normally the case for P).
 - The double use of ""j"" (admittedly, with different fonts) in (6) may be misleading.
 - Results tables could repeat the units of the measurements (in particular as they are heterogenous in Table 1).

I think that this paper is a clear accept. One could argue that experiments could be conducted on different environments or that the novelty is limited, but I feel that ""correct"" (no-nonsense, experimentally sound on Doom, appendix providing details for reproducibility) and ""milestone"" (vizDoom winner) papers should get published.",,8.0,4.0
49,True,Learning to Act by Predicting the Future,"Deep RL (using deep neural networks for function approximators in RL algorithms) have had a number of successes solving RL in large state spaces. This empirically driven work builds on these approaches. It introduces a new algorithm which performs better in novel 3D environments from raw sensory data and allows better generalization across goals and environments. Notably, this algorithm was the winner of the Visual Doom AI competition.

The key idea of their algorithm is to use additional low-dimensional observations (such as ammo or health which is provided by the game engine) as a supervised target for prediction. Importantly, this prediction is conditioned on a goal vector (which is given, not learned) and the current action. Once trained the optimal action for the current state can be chosen as the action that maximises the predicted outcome according the goal. Unlike in successor feature representations, learning is supervised and there is no TD relationship between the predictions of the current state and the next state.

There have been a number of prior works both in predicting future states as part of RL and goal driven function approximators which the authors review in section 2. The key contributions of this work are the focus on Monte Carlo estimation (rather than TD), the use of low-dimensional ‘measurements’ for prediction, the parametrized goals and, perhaps most importantly, the empirical comparison to relevant prior work.

In addition to the comparison with Visual Doom AI, the authors show that their algorithm is able to learn generalizable policies which can respond, without further training, to limited changes in the goal.

The paper is well-communicated and the empirical results compelling and will be of significant interest.

Some minor potential improvements:
There is an approximation in the supervised training as it is making an on-policy assumption but it learns from a replay buffer (with the Monte Carlo regression the expectation of the remainder of the trajectory is assumed to follow the current policy, but is being sampled from episodes generated by prior versions of the policy). This should be discussed.
The algorithm uses additional metadata (the information about which parts of the sensory input are worth predicting) that the compared algorithms do not. I think this, and the limitations of this approach (e.g. it may not work well in a sensory environment if such measurements are not provided) should be mentioned more clearly.

- I would have liked to see failure modes of this approach. Under what circumstances does the model have problems generalizing to changing goals? There are other conceptual problems -- since this is an on-policy method, there will be catastrophic forgetting if the agent dosen't repeatedly train on goals from the distant past. 

- Since the main contribution of this paper is to integrate several key ideas and show empirical advantage, I would have liked to see results on other domains like Atari (maybe using the ROM as intrinsic variables)

51,True,Learning to Act by Predicting the Future,"It's interesting to see that by purely using predictions over the differences between measurements for future step(s) and the presented step, the learning performance could surpass A3C and DSR in Doom. I have the following questions:

(1) In Figure 1, why there is a ""Target f"" drawn to the right of ""Prediction P""? Though this makes the model looks more end-to-end, I guess the ""Expectation"" component and ""Action"" component are updating their parameters according to their own regression losses, instead of back-propagating through a unified end. 

(2) The reward formulation in this work is similar to Monte-Carlo methods. In this work, the cumulative reward is represented by summing up the outputs of expectation stream and action stream *over each time steps*. If only those over the last time step is considered, it will become almost same as Monte-Carlo. However, the presented work accumulates the difference over multiple future steps. Based on the proposed form of *f* (in Section 3), the reward collected by near-future steps are weighted more. Or we could see the weight to be interpreted as linearly decaying based on the time distance from the future step to the current step. If this is the case, re-formulating the proposed approach with linearly discounted Monte-Carlo could be possible. You may also compare such Monte-Carlo as a compelling baseline. Also, it's better to put more discussion over your reward formulation, since it contributes a lot to the performance improvement and it's better to let people understand why it works well. 

(3) I don't quite understand what is the meaning of *goal*. In Section 3, *g* is proposed to be of the same dimension as  *f*. The maximization is over g^T*f, but what the architecture try to regress is over f, and g is designed as part of inputs to the deep neural network. And action-selection is over the maximum of summed E and A over all future steps. In this way, what the agent is trying to do is to maximize the future gain over those measurements, instead of performing according to the specified goal. Hope the authors could clarify on this.

It seems the authors could get competitive performance on CIFAR-10 to state of art models with only Wide Res Nets. Wide Gated ResNet requires much more parameters than DenseNet (and other Res Net variants) for obtaining a little improvement over Dense Net.  More importantly, the authors state that they obtained the best results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 but the updated version of DenseNet (Huang et al. (2016b)) has new results for a version called DenseNet-BC which outperforms all of the results that authors reported (3.46 for CIFAR-10 and 17.18 for CIFAR-100 with 25.6M parameters, DenseNet-BC still outperforms with 15.3M parameters which is much less that 36.5M). The Res Net variants papers with state of art results report result for Image Net. Therefore the empirical results need also the Image Net to demonstrate that improvement claimed is achieved.

The basic idea of the paper is simple and is clearly presented. It is a natural simplification of highway networks to allow easily ""shutting off"" layers while keeping number of additional parameters low. However, in this regard the paper leaves out a few key points. Firstly, it does not mention that the gates in highway networks are data-dependent which is potentially more powerful than learning a fixed gate for all units and independent of data. Secondly, it does not do a fair comparison with highway networks to show that this simpler formulation is indeed easier to learn.

Did the authors try their original design of u = g(k)f(x) + (1 - g(k))x where f(x) is a plain layer instead of a residual layer? Based on the arguments made in the paper, this should work fine. Why wasn't it tested? If it doesn't work, are the arguments incorrect or incomplete?

For the MNIST experiments, since the hyperparameters are fixed, the plots are misleading if any dependence on hyperparameters exists for the different models. This experiment appears to be based on Srivastava et al (2015). If it is indeed designed to test optimization at aggressive depths, then apart from doing a hyperparameter search, the authors should not use regularization such as dropout or batch norm, which do not appear in the theoretical arguments for the architecture.

For CIFAR experiments, the obtained improvements compared to the baseline (wide resnets) are very small and therefore it is important to report the standard deviations (or all results) in both cases. It's not clear that the differences are significant.

The main difference between this work and differentiable architectures, like NTM, Neural GPU, NRAM, etc. is the fact that here the authors aim at automatically producing code that solves the given task.

My main concern are experiments - it would be nice to see a comparison to some of the neural networks mentioned in related work. Also, it would be useful to see how this model is doing on typical problems used by mentioned neural architectures (problems such as ""sorting"", ""merging"", ""adding""). I'm wondering how this is going to generalize to other types of programs that can't be solved with prefix-loop-suffix structure.

It is also concerning that although  1) the tasks are simple, 2) the structure of the solution is very restricted and 3) model is using extensions doing most of the work, the proposed model still fails to find solutions (example: A+L model that has “loop” fails to solve “list length” task in 84% of the runs).

59,False,Neural Functional Programming,"This paper presents design decisions of TerpreT [1] and experiments about learning simple loop programs and list manipulation tasks. The TerpreT line of work (is one of those which) bridges the gap between the programming languages (PL) and machine learning (ML) communities. Contrasted to the recent interest of the ML community for program induction, the focus here is on using the design of the programming language to reduce the search space. Namely, here, they used the structure of the control flow (if-then-else, foreach, zipWithi, and foldli ""templates""), immutable data (no reuse of a ""neural"" memory), and types (they tried penalizing ill-typedness, and restricting the search only to well-typed programs, which works better). My bird eye view would be that this stands in between ""make everything continuous and perform gradient descent"" (ML) and ""discretize all the things and perform structured and heuristics-guided combinatorial search"" (PL).

I liked that they have a relevant baseline (\lambda^2), but I wished that they also included a fully neural network program synthesis baseline. Admittedly, it would not succeed except on the simplest tasks, but I think some of their experimental tasks are simple enough for ""non-generating code "" NNs to succeed on.

I wished that TerpreT was available, and the code to reproduce these experiments too.

I wonder if/how the (otherwise very interesting!) recommendations for the design of programming languages to perform gradient descent based-inductive programming would hold/perform on harder task than these loops. Even though these tasks are already interesting and challenging, I wonder how much of these tasks biased the search for good subset of constraints (e.g. those for structuring the control flow).

Overall, I think that the paper is good enough to appear at ICLR, but I am no expert in program induction / synthesis.

This aids stability and limited-data performance. The paper is well written, the contribution of combining Scattering and CNNs is novel and the results seem promising. I feel that such work was a missing piece in the Scattering literature to make it useful for practical applications.

I wish the authors would have investigated the effect of the stable bottom layers with respect to adversarial examples. This can be done in a relatively straightforward way with software like cleverhans [1] or deep fool [2]. It would be very interesting if the first layer's stability in the hybrid architectures increases robustness significantly, as this would tell us that these fooling images are related to low-level geometry. Finding that this is not the case, would be very interesting as well.

Further, the proposed architecture is not evaluated on real limited data problems. This would further strengthen the improved generalization claim. However, I admit that the Cifar-100 / Cifar-10 difference already seems like a promising indicator in this regard.

63,False,A hybrid network: Scattering and Convnet,"The paper investigates a hybrid network consisting of a scattering network followed by a convolutional network. By using scattering layers, the number of parameters is reduced, and the first layers are guaranteed to be stable to deformations. Experiments show that the hybrid network achieves reasonable performance, and outperforms the network-in-network architecture in the small-data regime.

I have often heard researchers ask why it is necessary to re-learn low level features of convolutional networks every time they are trained. In theory, using fixed features could save parameters and training time. As far as I am aware, this paper is the first to investigate this question. In my view, the results show that using scattering features in the bottom layers does not work as well as learned CNN features. This is not completely obvious a priori, and so the results are interesting, but I disagree with the framing that the hybrid network is superior in terms of generalization.

For the low-data regime, the hybrid network sometimes gives better accuracy than NiN, but this is quite an old architecture and its capacity has not been tuned to the dataset size. For the full dataset, the hybrid network is clearly outperformed by fully learned models. If I understood correctly, the authors have not simply compared identical architectures with and without scattering as the first layers, which further complicates drawing a conclusion.

The authors claim the hybrid network has the theoretical advantage of stability. However, only the first layers of a hybrid network will be stable, while the learned ones can still create instability. Furthermore, if potentially unstable deep networks outperform stable scattering nets and partially-stable hybrid nets, we have to question the importance of stability as defined in the theory of scattering networks. 

In conclusion, I think the paper investigates a relevant question, but I am not convinced that the hybrid network really generalizes better than standard deep nets. Faster computation (at test time) could be useful e.g. in low power and mobile devices, but this aspect is not really fleshed out in the paper.

64,False,A hybrid network: Scattering and Convnet,"Thanks a lot for your detailed response and clarifications.

The paper proposes to use a scattering transform as the lower layers of a deep network. This fixed representation enjoys good geometric properties (local invariance to deformations) and can be thought as a form of regularization or prior. The top layers of the network are trained to perform a given supervised task. This is the final model can be thought as plugging a standard deep convolutional network on top of the scattering transform. Evaluation on CIFAR 10 and 100 shows that the proposed approach achieves performance competitive with high performing baselines.

I find the paper very interesting. The idea of cascading these representations seems very natural thing to try. To the best of my knowledge this is the first work that combines predefined and generic representations with modern CNN architectures achieving competitive performance to high performing approaches. While the state of the art (Resnets and variants) achieves significantly higher performances, I believe that this work strongly delivers it's point.

The paper convincingly shows that lower level invariances can be obtained from analytic representations (scattering transform), simplifying the training process (using less parameters) and allowing for faster evaluation. The of the hybrid approach become crucial in the low data regime. 

The author argues that with the scattering initialisation instabilities cannot occur in the first layers contrary as the operator is non-expansive. This naturally suggests that the model is more robust to adversarial examples. It would be extremely interesting to present an empirical evaluation of this task. What's the practical impact? Can this hybrid network be fooled with adversarial? If this is the case, it would render the use of scattering initialization very attractive.

There is a long experimental section, but I am not sure what the conclusion is. The authors appear to be somewhat confused themselves. The amount of ""maybe"" ""could mean"", ""perhaps"" etc. statements in the paper is exceptionally high. For this paper to be accepted it needs a bold statement about the performance, with a solid evidence. In my opinion, that is lacking as of now. This approach is either a breakthrough or a dud, and after reading the paper I am not convinced which case it is.

67,False,Parametric Exponential Linear Unit for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"This paper proposes a modification of the ELU activation function for neural networks, by parameterizing it with 2 trainable parameters per layer. This parameter is proposed to more effectively counter vanishing gradients. 

My main concern regarding this paper is related to the authors' claims about the effectiveness of PELU. The analysis in Sections 2 and 3 discusses how PELU might improve training by combating gradient propagation issues. This by itself does not imply that improved generalization will result, only that models may be easier to train. However, the experiments all seek to demonstrate improved generalization performance.
But this could in principle be due to a better inductive bias, and have nothing to do with the optimization analysis. None of the experiments are designed to directly support the stated theoretical advantage of PELU compared to ELU in optimizing models.

In the response to the pre-review question, the authors state that the claims in Section 2 and 3.3 are meant to apply to generalization performance. I fail to see how this is true for most claims, except the flexibility claim. As the authors agree, better training may or may not lead to better out-of-sample performance. I can only agree that having flexibility can sometimes help the network adapt its inductive bias to the problem (instead of overfitting), but this is a much weaker claim compared to the mathematical justifications for improved optimization.

On selection of learning hyperparameters:
The authors state in the discussion on OpenReview that the learning rates selected were favorable to ReLU, and not PELU. However, this does not guarantee that they were not unfavorable to ELU. It raises the question: can a regime be constructed where ELU has better performance than PELU? If so, how can we draw the conclusion that PELU is better?

68,True,Program Synthesis for Character Level Language Modeling,"This paper introduces a novel method for language modeling which is suitable for both modeling programming language as well as natural language. The approach uses a program synthesis algorithm to search over program space and uses count-based estimation of the weights of the program. This is a departure from neural network-based approaches which rely on gradient descent, and thus are extremely slow to estimate. Count-based method such as regular n-gram models suffer because of their simplicity, i.e. not being able to model large context, and scaling badly as context increases. The proposed approach synthesizes programs using MCMC which learn context-sensitive probabilities using count-based estimation, and thus is both fast and able to model long-range context.

Experiments on a programming language datasets, the linux kernel corpus, show that this method is vastly better than both LSTM and n-gram language models. Experiments on the Wikipedia corpus show that the method is competitive, but not better, to SOTA models. Both estimation and query time are significantly better than LSTM LMs, and competitive to n-gram LMs.

It's debatable whether this paper is suitable for ICLR, due to ICLR's focus on neural network-based approaches. However, in the interest of diversity and novelty, such ""outside"" papers should be accepted to ICLR. This paper is likely to inspire more research into fusion of program synthesis and machine learning methods, which was a popular theme at NIPS 2016.

69,True,Program Synthesis for Character Level Language Modeling,"This paper proposes an approach to character language modeling (CLMs) based on developing a domain specific language to represent CLMs. The experiments show mixed performance versus neural CLM approaches to modeling linux kernel data and wikipedia text, however the proposed DSL models are slightly more compact and fast to query as compared with neural CLMs. The proposed approach is difficult to understand overall and perhaps is aimed towards the sub-community already working on this sort of approach but lacks sufficient explanation for the ICLR audience. Critically the paper glosses over the major issues of demonstrating the proposed DSL is a valid probabilistic model and how training is performed to fit the model to data (there is clearly not a gradient-based training approach used). FInally the experiments feel incomplete without showing samples drawn from the generative model or analyzing the learned model to determine what it has learned. Overall I feel this paper does not describe the approach in enough depth for readers to understand or re-implement it.

Almost all of the model section is devoted to exposition of the DSL without specifying how probabilities are computed using this model and how training is performed. How are probabilities actually encoded? The DSL description seems to have only discrete decisions rather than probabilities.

Training is perhaps covered in previous papers but there needs to be some discussion of how it works here. Section 2.5 does not do enough to explain how training works or how any measure of optimality is achieved.

Given this model is quite a different hypothesis space from neural models or n-grams, looking and samples drawn from the model seems critical. The current experiments show it can score utterances relatively well but it would be very interesting if the model can sample more structured samples than neural approaches (for example long-range syntax constraints like brackets)",,5.0,3.0

Strong empirical results are obtained on modeling code, though there is some gap between the synthesis method and neural methods on the Hutter task. A detailed description of the language syntax is provided.

Cons/suggestions:
- The synthesis procedure using MCMC is left very vague, even though being able to make this procedure efficient is one of the key questions.

71,False,Beyond Bilingual: Multi-sense Word Embeddings using Multilingual Context,"In this paper, the authors propose a Bayesian variant of the skipgram model to learn word embeddings. There are two important variant compared to the original model. First, aligned sentences from multiple languages are used to train the model. Therefore, the context words of a given target word can be either from the same sentence, or from an aligned sentence in a different language. This allows to learn multilingual embedding. The second difference is that each word is represented by multiple vectors, one for each of its different senses. A latent variable z models which sense should be used, given the context.

Overall, I believe that the idea of using a probabilistic model to capture polysemy is an interesting idea. The model introduced in this paper is a nice generalization of the skipgram model in that direction. However, I found the paper a bit hard to follow. The formulation might probably be simplified (e.g. why not consider a target word w and a context c, where c is either in the source or target language. Since all factors are independent, this should not change the model much, and would make the presentation easier). The performance of all models reported in Table 2 & 3 seem pretty low.

While this idea in itself isn't new, the authors propose a particular setup for learning multi-sense embeddings by exploiting multilingual data.

Broadly this is fine, but unfortunately the paper then falls short in a number of ways. For one, the model section is unnecessarily convoluted for what is a nice idea that could be described in a far more concise fashion. Next (and more importantly), comparison with other work is lacking to such an extent that it is impossible to evaluate the merits of the proposed model in an objective fashion.

From a computational linguistics perspective, the fact that languages less similar to English help more is intriguing. I see following problem with this work:
- the paper is hard to follow and hard to see what's new compared to the baseline model [1]. A paragraph of discussion should clearly compare and contrast with that work.

- the proposed model is a slight variation of the previous work [1] thus the experimental setup should be designed in a way so that we compare which part helps improvement and how much. thus MONO has not been exposed the same training data and we can't be sure that the proposed model is better because MONO does not observe the data or lacks the computational power. I suggest following baseline: turning multilingual data to monolingual one using the alignment, then train the baseline model[1] on this pseudo monolingual data.

- the paper provides good benchmarks for intrinsic evaluation but the message could be conveyed more strongly if we see improvement in a downstream task.

74,False,Learning Word-Like Units from Joint Audio-Visual Analylsis,"CONTRIBUTIONS 
This paper introduces a method for learning semantic ""word-like"" units jointly from audio and visual data. The authors use a multimodal neural network architecture which accepts both image and audio (as spectrograms) inputs. Joint training allows one to embed both image and spoken language captions into a shared representation space. Audio-visual groundings are generated by measuring affinity between image patches and audio clips. This allows the model to relate specific visual regions to specific audio segments. Experiments cover image search (audio to image) and annotation (image to audio) tasks and acoustic word discovery.


NOVELTY+SIGNIFICANCE
As correctly mentioned in Section 1.2, the computer vision and natural language communities have studied multimodal learning for use in image captioning and retrieval. With regards to multimodal learning, this paper offers incremental advancements since it primarily uses a novel combination of input modalities (audio and images).

However, bidirectional image/audio retrieval has already been explored by the authors in prior work (Harwath et al, NIPS 2016). Apart from minor differences in data and CNN architecture, the training procedure in this submission is identical to this prior work. The novelty in this submission is therefore the procedure for using the trained model for associating image regions with audio subsequences.

The methods employed for this association are relatively straightforward combination of standard techniques with limited novelty. The trained model is used to compute alignment scores between densely sampled image regions and audio subsequences; from these alignment scores a number of heuristics are applied to associate clusters of image regions with clusters of audio subsequences.

POSITIVE POINTS
- Using more data and an improved CNN architecture, this paper improves on prior work for bidirectional image/audio retrieval
- The presented method performs efficient acoustic pattern discovery
- The audio-visual grounding combined with the image and acoustic cluster analysis is successful at discovering audio-visual cluster pairs

NEGATIVE POINTS
- Limited novelty, especially compared with Harwath et al, NIPS 2016
- Although it gives good results, the clustering method has limited novelty and feels heuristic
- The proposed method includes many hyperparameters (patch size, acoustic duration, VAD threshold, IoU threshold, number of k-means clusters, etc) and there is no discussion of how these were set or the sensitivity of the method to these choices",,5.0,4.0

The analysis is very interesting and I really like where the authors are going with this.

My main concern is novelty. It feels like this work is a rather trivial follow-up on an existing model, which is fine, but then the analysis should be more satisfying: currently, it feels like the authors are just illustrating some of the things that the NIPS model (with some minor improvements) learns. For a more interesting analysis, I would have liked things like a comparison of different segmentation approaches (both in audio and in images), i.e., suppose we have access to the perfect segmentation in both modalities, what happens? It would also be interesting to look at what is learned with the grounded representation, and evaluate e.g. on multi-modal semantics tasks.

Apart from that, the paper is well written and I really like this research direction. It is very important to analyze what models learn, and this is a good example of the types of questions one should ask.

A major concern is the amount of novelty between this work and the author's previous publication at NIPs 2016. The authors claim a more sophisticated architecture and indeed show an improvement in recall. However, the improvements are marginal, and the added complexity to the architecture is a bit ad hoc. Clustering and grouping in section 4, is hacky. Instead of gridding the image, the authors could actually use an object detector (SSD, Yolo, FasterRCNN, etc.) to estimate accurate object proposals; rather than using k-means, a spectral clustering approach would alleviate the gaussian assumption of the distributions. In assigning visual hypotheses with acoustic segments, some form of bi-partite matching should be used.

78,False,Extensions and Limitations of the Neural GPU,"The authors investigate the neural GPU model introduced by Kaiser and Sutskever. In section 3 they claim its performance is due to the O(n^2) number of steps it can perform for each example. In the subsequent section they highlight the importance of curriculum training and empirically show that larger models generalize better. In section 5 they construct examples that reveal failure modes. In the last section they compare the performance given different input formats.

The paper is well written. It contains an exhaustive set of experiments which provide insight into the details of training the neural GPU model. It pushes the boundary of algorithms that can be learned further. On the other hand, the paper seems to lack a coherent message. It also fails to provide any insight into the how and why of the observations made (i.e. why curriculum training is essential and why certain failure modes exist).

The introduction contains several statements which should be qualified or explained further. As far as I am aware statistical learning theory does not guarantee that empirical risk minimization is consistent when the number of parameters is larger than the number of examples; the generalization performance depends on the VC dimension of the function space instead. Furthermore, the suggested link between adversarial examples and learning algorithms is tenuous, and references or a further explanation should be provided for the contentious statement that deep neural networks are able to match the performance of any parallel machine learning algorithm.

The authors argue that the neural GPU performs O(n^2) “steps” on each example, which allows it to learn algorithms with super-linear complexity such as multiplication. This analysis seems to overlook the parallel nature of the neural GPU architecture: Both addition and multiplication have O(log n) time complexity when parallelism is used (cf. a carry-lookahead adder and a Wallace tree respectively).

In section 4 the authors show that their larger models generalize better, which they argue is not self-evident. However, since both training and test error decrease it is likely that the smaller models are underfitting, in which case it is not counter-intuitive at all that a larger model would have better generalization error.

It is interesting to see that progressively decreasing the number of terms and increasing the radix of the number system works well as a learning curriculum, although it would be nice to have a stronger intuitive or theoretical justification for the latter.

The final section claims that neural GPUs are cellular automata. Further justification for this statement would be useful, since cellular automata are discrete models, and the equivalence between both models is in no way obvious. The relationship between global operations and changing the input format is circuitous.

In conclusion, the paper provides some useful insights into the neural GPU model, but does not introduce original extensions to the model and does not explain any fundamental limitations. Several statements require stronger substantiation.

The paper is significantly improved from the original submission and reflects changes based on pre-review questions. However, while there was an attempt made to include more qualitative results e.g. Fig. 2, it is still relatively weak and could benefit from more examples and analysis. Also, why is the attention in Fig. 2 always attending over the full character?  Although it is zooming in, shouldn’t it attend to relevant parts of the character?  Attending to the full character on a solid background seems a trivial solution where it is then unclear where the large performance gains are coming from.

After reading this paper, I'm left a little perplexed as to where the big performance improvements are coming from as it seems to share a lot of the same components of previous work.

As it stands, I'm not sure I understand everything. I would also have liked to see exactly described what the various labels in Fig 1 correspond to (""SGD task-wise, 1 comm""? Did you mean layer-wise?).
There are a couple of major issues with the evaluation: first, no comparison is reported against baseline async methods such as using a parameter server. Second, using AlexNet as a benchmark is not informative at all. AlexNet looks very different from any SOTA image recognition model, and in particular it has many fewer layers, which is especially relevant to the discussion in 6.3. It also uses lots of fully-connected layers which affect the compute/communication ratios in ways that are not relevant to most interesting architectures today.",,3.0,5.0

1) The described manual implementation of delayed synchronization and state protection is helpful. However, such dependency been implemented by a dependency scheduler, without doing threading manually.
2) The overlap of computation and communication is a known technique implemented in existing solutions such as TensorFlow(as described in Chen et.al) and MXNet. The claimed contribution of this point is somewhat limited.
3) The convergence accuracy is only reported for the beginning iterations and only on AlexNet. It would be more helpful to include convergence curve till the end for all compared networks.

Also, the paper does not evaluate the wallclock time to reach convergence or a given accuracy. Even though the AGD approach has more iterations per second, it also leads to poorer convergence (as acknowledged in Table 1). As a specific example, to reach 0.01688 accuracy requires <2000 iterations of SGD, <3000 iterations of AGD (1 comm), and 5000 iterations of AGD (2 comm). Hence, for AGD to be faster than SGD in wallclock time, AGD must have at 1.5x iterations per second relative to SGD, which does not appear to the case from Figure 1. Of course, this example is only for a low accuracy of 0.01688, and the proposed AGD could very well reach the final convergence of 54% in lesser time.

I am not an expert on ITP or theorem proving, so I will present a review from more of a ML perspective. I feel one of the goals of the paper should be to present the problem to a ML audience in a way that is easy for them to grasp. While most of the paper is well written, there are some sections that are not clear (especially section 2):
-	Terms such as LCF, OCaml-top level, deBruijn indices have been used without explaining or any references. These terms might be trivial in ITP literature, but were hard for me to follow.  
-	Section 2 describes how the data was splits into train and test set. One thing which is unclear is – can the examples in the train and test set be statements about the same conjecture or are they always statements about different conjectures? 


It also unclear how the deep learning models are applied. Let’s consider the leftmost architecture in Figure 1. Each character is embedded into 256-D vector – and processed until the global max-pooling layer. Does this layer take a max along each feature and across all characters in the input? 

My another concern is only deep learning methods are presented as baselines. It would be great to compare with standard NLP techniques such as Bag of Words followed by SVM. I am sure these would be outperformed by neural networks, but the numbers would give a sense of how easy/hard the current problem setup is. 

Did the authors look at the success and failure cases of the algorithm? Are there any insights that can be drawn from such analysis that can inform design of future models? 

Overall I think the research direction of using ML for theorem proving is an interesting one. However, I also feel the paper is quite opaque. Many parts of how the data is constructed is unclear (atleast to someone with little knowledge in ITPs). If authors can revise the text to make it clearer – it would be great. The baseline models seem to perform quite well, however there are no insights into what kind of ability the models are lacking. Authors mention that they are unable to perform logical reasoning – but that’s a very vague statement. Some examples of mistakes might help make the message clearer. Further, since I am not well versed with the ITP literature it’s not possible for me to judge how valuable is this dataset. From the references, it seems like it’s drawn from a set of benchmark conjectures/proofs used in the ITP community – so its possibly a good dataset.

89,False,Energy-Based Spherical Sparse Coding,"First, I'd like to thank the authors for their answers and clarifications.
I find, the presentation of the multi-stage version of the model much clearer now.

Pros:

+ The paper states a sparse coding problem using cosine loss, which allows to solve the problem in a single pass.

+ The energy-based formulation allows bi-directional coding that incorporates top-down and bottom-up information in the feature extraction process. 

Cons:

+ The cost of running the evaluation could be large in the  multi-class setting, rendering the approach less attractive and the computational cost comparable to recurrent architectures.

+ While the model is competitive and improves over the baseline, the paper would be more convincing with other comparisons (see text). The experimental evaluation is limited (a single database and a single baseline)

------

The motivation of the sparse coding scheme is to perform inference in a feed forward manner. This property does not hold in the multi stage setting, thus optimization would be required (as clarified by the authors).

Having an efficient way of performing a bi-directional coding scheme is very interesting. As the authors clarified, this could not necessarily be the case, as the model needs to be evaluated many times for performing a classification.

Maybe an interesting combination would be to run the model without any class-specific bias, and evaluation only the top K predictions with the energy-based setting.

Having said this, it would be good to include a discussion (if not direct comparisons) of the trade-offs of using a model as the one proposed by Cao et al. Eg. computational costs, performance.

Using the bidirectional coding only on the top layers seems reasonable: one can get a good low level representation in a class agnostic way. This, however could be studied in more detail, for instance showing empirically the trade offs. If I understand correctly, now only one setting is being reported.

Finally, the authors mention that one benefit of using the architecture derived from the proposed coding method is the spherical normalization scheme, which can lead to smoother optimization dynamics. Does the baseline (or model) use batch-normalization? If not, seems relevant to test.

The proposed method seems technically sound, and it introduces a new way to efficiently train a CNN layer-wise by combining reconstruction and discriminative objectives.

----------

This paper addresses the problem of training stochastic feedforward neural networks.  It proposes to transfer weights from a deterministic deep neural network trained using standard procedures (including techniques such as dropout and batch normalization) to a stochastic network having the same topology.  The initial mechanism described for performing the transfer involves a rescaling of unit inputs and layer weights, and appropriate specification of the stochastic latent units if the DNN used for pretraining employs ReLU nonlinearities.  Initial experiments on MNIST classification and a toy generative task with a multimodal target distribution show that the simple transfer process works well if the DNN used for pretraining uses sigmoid nonlinearities, but not if the pretraining DNN uses ReLUs.  To tackle this problem, the paper introduces the ""simplified stochastic feedforward neural network,"" in which every stochastic layer is followed by a layer that takes an expectation over samples from its input, thus limiting the propagation of stochasticity in the network.  A modified process for transferring weights from a pretraining DNN to the simplified SFNN is described and justified.  The training process then occurs in three steps:  (1) pretrain a DNN, (2) transfer weights from the DNN to a simplified SFNN and continue training, and (3) optionally transfer the weights to a full SFNN and continue training or transfer them to a deterministic model (called DNN*) and continue training.  The third step can be skipped and the simplified SFNN may also be used directly as an inference model.  Experimental results on MNIST classification show that the use of simplified SFNN training can improve a deterministic DNN* model over a DNN baseline trained with batch normalization and dropout.  Experiments on two generative tasks (MNIST-half and the Toronto Faces Database) show that the proposed pretraining process improves test set negative log-likelihoods.  Finally, experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN with the LeNet-5, network-in-network, and wide residual network architectures show that use of a stochastic training step can improve performance of a deterministic (DNN*) model.

It is a bit confusing to refer to ""multi-modal"" tasks, when what is meant is ""generative tasks with a multimodal target distribution"" because ""multi-modal"" task can also refer to a learning task that crosses sensory modalities such as audio-visual speech recognition, text-based image retrieval, or image captioning.  I recommend that you use the more precise term (""generative tasks with a multimodal target distribution"") early in the introduction and then say that you will refer to such tasks as ""multi-modal tasks"" in the rest of the paper for the sake of brevity.

The paper would be easier to read if ""SFNN"" were not used to refer to both the singular (""stochastic feedforward neural network"") and plural (""stochastic feedforward neural networks"") cases.  When the plural is meant, write ""SFNNs"".

In Table 1, why does the 3 hidden layer SFNN initialized from a ReLU DNN have so much worse of a test NLL than the 2 hidden layer SFNN initialized from a ReLU DNN?

The notation that uses superscripts to indicate layer indexes is confusing.  The reader naturally parses N² as ""N squared"" and not as ""the number of units in the second layer.""

When you transfer weights back from the simplified SFNN to the DNN* model, do you need to perform some sort of rescaling that undoes the operations in Equation (8) in the paper?

What does NCSFNN stand for in the supplementary material?

Pros
+ The proposed model is easy to implement and apply to other tasks.
+ The MNIST results showing that the stochastic model training can produce a deterministic model (called DNN* in the paper) that generalizes better than a DNN trained with batch normalization and dropout is quite exciting.

Cons
- For the reasons outlined above, the paper is at times a bit hard to follow.
- The results CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN would be more convincing if the baselines used dropout and batch normalization.  While this is shown on MINST, demonstration of a similar result on a more challenging task would strengthen the paper.

99,False,What Is the Best Practice for CNNs Applied to Visual Instance Retrieval?,"This paper explores different strategies for instance-level image retrieval with deep CNNs. The approach consists of extracting features from a network pre-trained for image classification (e.g. VGG), and post-process them for image retrieval. In other words, the network is off-the-shelf and solely acts as a feature extractor. The post-processing strategies are borrowed from traditional retrieval pipelines relying on hand-crafted features (e.g. SIFT + Fisher Vectors), denoted by the authors as ""traditional wisdom"".

Specifically, the authors examine where to extract features in the network (i.e. features are neurons activations of a convolution layer), which type of feature aggregation and normalization performs best, whether resizing images helps, whether combining multiple scales helps, and so on. 

While this type of experimental study is reasonable and well motivated, it suffers from a huge problem. Namely it ""ignores"" 2 major recent works that are in direct contradictions with many claims of the paper ([a] ""End-to-end Learning of Deep Visual Representations for Image Retrieval"" by  Gordo et al. and [b] ""CNN Image Retrieval Learns from BoW: Unsupervised Fine-Tuning with Hard Examples"" by Radenović et al., both ECCV'16 papers). These works have shown that training for retrieval can be achieved with a siamese architectures and have demonstrated outstanding performance. As a result, many claims and findings of the paper are either outdated, questionable or just wrong.

Here are some of the misleading claims: 

  - ""Features aggregated from these feature maps have been exploited for image retrieval tasks and achieved state-of-the-art performances in recent years.""
  Until [a] (not cited), the state-of-the-art was still largely dominated by sparse invariant features based methods (see last Table in [a]).
  
  - ""the proposed method [...] outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four typical datasets""
  That is not true, for the same reasons than above, and also because the state-of-the-art is now dominated by [a] and [b].
  
  - ""Also in situations where a large numbers of training samples are not available, instance retrieval using unsupervised method is still preferable and may be the only option."".
  This is a questionable opinion. The method exposed in ""End-to-end Learning of Deep Visual Representations for Image Retrieval"" by Gordo et al. outperforms the state-of-the-art on the UKB dataset (3.84 without QE or DBA) whereas it was trained for landmarks retrieval and not objects, i.e. in a different retrieval context. This demonstrates that in spite of insufficient training data, training is still possible and beneficial.

  - Finally, most findings are not even new or surprising (e.g. aggregate several regions in a multi-scale manner was already achieved by Tolias at al, etc.). So the interest of the paper is limited overall.

In addition, there are some problems in the experiments. For instance, the tuning experiments are only conducted on the Oxford dataset and using a single network (VGG-19), whereas it is not clear whether these conditions are well representative of all datasets and all networks (it is well known that the Oxford dataset behaves very differently than the Holidays dataset, for instance). In addition, tuning is performed very aggressively, making it look like the authors are tuning on the test set (e.g. see Table 3).

Technically, the contribution is clear, particularly with the promised clarifications on how multiple scales are handled in the representation. However, I am still not entirely clear whether there would be a difference in the multi-scale settting for full and cropped queries.

While the paper focuses on comparing different baseline architectures for CNN-based image retrieval, several recent papers have proposed to learn end-to-end representations specific for this task, with very good result (see for instance the recent work by Gordo et al. ""End-to-end Learning of Deep Visual Representations for Image Retrieval""). The authors clarify that their work is orthogonal to papers such as Gordo et al. as they assess instead the performance of networks pre-trained from image classification. In fact, they also indicate that image retrieval is more difficult than image classification -- this is because it is performed by using features originally trained for classification. I can partially accept this argument. However, given the results in recent papers, it is clear than end-to-end training is far superior in practice and it is not clear the analysis developed by the authors in this work would transfer or be useful for that case as well.

For detailed comments on everything see the questions I posted earlier. The summary is here:

I don't think we learn much from this paper: we already knew that we should use the last conv layer, we knew we should use PCA with whitening, we knew we should use original size images (authors say Tolias didn't do this as they resized the images, but they did this exactly for the same reason as authors didn't evaluate on Holidays - the images are too big. So they basically used ""as large as possible"" image sizes, which is what this paper effectively suggests as well), etc. This paper essentially concatenates methods that people have already used, and performs some more parameter tweaking to achieve the state-of-the-art (while the tweaking is actually performed on the test set of some of the tests).

The setting of the state-of-the-art results is quite misleading as it doesn't really come from the good choice of parameters, but mainly due to the usage of the deeper VGG-19 network. 

Furthermore, I don't think it's sufficient to just try one network and claim these are the best practices for using CNNs for instance retrieval - what about ResNet, what about Inception, I don't know how to apply any of these conclusions for those networks, and would these conclusions even hold for them. Furthermore the parameter tweaking was done on Oxford, I really can't tell what conclusions would we get if we tuned on UKB for example.

102,True,Nonparametric Neural Networks,"This paper proposes a nonparametric neural network model, which automatically learns the size of the model during the training process. The key idea is to randomly add zero units and use sparse regularizer to automatically null out the weights that are irrelevant. The idea sounds to be a random search approach over discrete space with the help of sparse regularization to eliminate useless units. This is an important problem and the paper gives interesting results. My main comments are listed below:

What is the additional computation complexity of the algorithm? The decomposition of each fan-in weights into a parallel component and an orthogonal component and the transformation into radial-angular coordinates may require a lot of extra computation time. The authors may need to discuss the extra amount of operations relative to the parametric neural network. Furthermore, it would be useful to show some running time experiments.

It is observed that nonparametric networks return small networks on the convex dataset so that it is inferior to parametric networks. Any insight on this?",,7.0,3.0
103,True,Nonparametric Neural Networks,"This paper addresses the problem of allowing networks to change the number of units that are used during training.  This is done in a simple but elegant and well-motivated way.  Units with zero input or output weights are added or removed during training, while a group sparsity norm for regularization is used to encourage unit weights to go to zero.  The main theoretical contribution is to show that with proper regularization, the loss is minimized by a network with a finite number of units.  In practice, this result does not guarantee that the resulting network will not over- or under-fit the training data, but some initial experiments show that this does not seem to be the case.

One potential advantage of approaches that learn the number of units to use in a network is to ease the burden of tuning hyperparameters.   One disadvantage of this approach (and maybe any such approach) is that it does not really solve this problem.  The network still has several hyperparameters that implicitly control the number of units that will emerge, including parameters that control how often new units are added and how rapidly weights may decay to zero.  It is not clear whether these hyperparameters will be easier or harder to tune than the ones in standard approaches.  In fairness, the authors do not claim that they have made training easier, but it is a little disappointing that this does not seem to be the case.

The authors do emphasize that they are able to train networks that use fewer units to achieve comparable performance to networks trained parametrically.  This is potentially important, because smaller networks can reduce run-time at testing, and power consumption and memory footprint, which is important on mobile devices in particular.  However, the authors do not compare experimentally to existing approaches that attempt to reduce the size of parametrically trained networks (eg., by pruning trained networks) so it is not clear whether this approach is really competitive with the best current approaches to reducing the size of trained networks.

Another potential disadvantage of the proposed approach is that the same hyperparameters control both the number of units that will appear in the network and the training time.  Therefore, training might potentially be much slower for this approach than for a parametric approach with fixed hyperparameters. In practice, many parametric approaches require methods like grid search to choose hyperparameters, which can be very slow, but in many other cases experience with similar problems can make the choice of hyperparameters relatively easy.  This means that the cost of grid search is not always paid, but the slowness of the authors’ approach may be endemic.  The authors do not discuss how this issue will scale as much larger networks are trained.  It is a concern that this approach may not be practical for large-scale networks, because training will be very slow.

In general, the experiments are helpful and encouraging, but not comprehensive or totally convincing.  I would want to see experiments on much larger problems before I was convinced that this approach can really be practical or widely useful.  

Overall, I found this to be an interesting and clearly written paper that makes a potentially useful point.  The overall vision of building networks that can grow and adapt through life-long learning is inspiring, and this type of work might be needed to realize such a vision.  But the current results remain pretty speculative.

The experimental section provides an evaluation of the rules that are found by the algorithm. Nonetheless, the work seems only at its first stages for now, and many questions are left open:

1) while the approach to find rules seems very general, the reason why it should work is unclear. What properties of the embedding space or of the initial algorithm are required for this approach to find meaningful rules? Can we apply the same principles to other algorithms than non-negative RESCAL?

2) there is no real evaluation in terms of link prediction. How can we use these rules in conjunction with the original algorithm to improve link prediction? What performance gains can be expected? Can these rules find links that would not be found be the original algorithm in the first place?

Specific comments:

The description of the R_l,pi convolutions in Section 2.1 was unclear. Specifically, I wasn't confident that I understood what the labels pi represented.

The description of the SAEN structure in section 2.2 was worded poorly. My understanding, based on Equation 1, is that the 'shift' operation is simply a summation of the representations of the member objects, and that the 'aggregate' operation simply concatenates the representations from multiple relations.  In the 'shift' step, it seems more appropriate to average over the object's member's representations h_j, rather than sum over them.

The compression technique presented in Section 2.3 requires that multiple objects at a level have the same representation. Why would this ever occur, given that the representations are real valued and high-dimensional? The text is unintelligible: ""two objects are equivalent if they are made by same sets of parts for all the pi-parameterizations of the R_l,pi decomposition relation.""

  1. Construct a hierarchical set of ""objects"" within the graph. Each object consists of multiple ""parts"" from the set of objects in the level below. There are potentially different ways a part can be part of an object (the different \pi labels), which I would maybe call ""membership types"". In the experiments, the objects at the bottom level are vertices. At the next level they are radius 0 (just a vertex?) and radius 1 neighborhoods around each vertex, and the membership types here are either ""root"", or ""element"" (depending on whether a vertex is the center of the neighborhood or a neighbor). At the top level there is one object consisting of all of these neighborhoods, with membership types of ""radius 0 neighborhood"" (isn't this still just a vertex?) or ""radius 1 neighborhood"".

  2. Every object has a representation. Each vertex's representation is a one-hot encoding of its degree. To construct an object's representation at the next level, the following scheme is employed:

    a. For each object, sum the representation of all of its parts having the same membership type.
    b. Concatenate the sums obtained from different membership types.
    c. Pass this vector through a multi-layer neural net.

The proposed approach is interesting and novel, the compression technique appears effective, and the results seem compelling. However, the clarity and structure of the writing is quite poor. It took me a while to figure out what was going on---the initial description is provided without any illustrative examples, and it required jumping around the paper to figure for example how the \pi labels are actually used. Important details around network architecture aren't provided, and very little in the way of motivation is given for many of the choices made. Were other choices of decomposition/object-part structures investigated, given the generality of the shift-aggregate-extract formulation? What motivated the choice of ""ego-graphs""?

111,True,Emergence of foveal image sampling from learning to attend in visual scenes,"This paper proposed a neural attention model which has a learnable and differentiable sampling lattice. The work is well motivated as few previous work focus on learning the sampling lattice but with a fixed lattice. This work is quite similar to Spatial Transformer Networks (Jaderberg 2015), but the sampling lattice is learned by the model. The experiments showed that the model can learn a meaning lattice to the visual search task where the sampling lattice looks similar to human being's. 

The main concern of the paper is that experiments are not sufficient. The paper only reports the results on a modified clustered MNIST dataset. It would be more interesting if the authors could conduct  the model on real datasets, such as Toronto Face dataset, CUB bird dataset and SVHN. For example, for the Face dataset, it would be nice if the model can learn to attend different parts of the face for expression recognition, or attend different part of birds for fine-grained classification. Since the authors replied in the pre-review question that the model can learn meaningful lattice on MSCOCO dataset, I think it would be better to add that results into the paper.

112,True,Emergence of foveal image sampling from learning to attend in visual scenes,"This paper presents a succinct argument that the principle of optimizing receptive field location and size in a simulated eye that can make saccades with respect to a classification error of images of data whose labels depend on variable-size and variable-location subimages, explains the existence of a foveal area in e.g. the primate retina.

The argument could be improved by using more-realistic image data and drawing more direct correspondence with the number, receptive field sizes and eccentricities of retinal cells in e.g. the macaque, but the authors would then face the challenge of identifying a loss function that is both biologically plausible and supportive of their claim.

The argument could also be improved by commenting on the timescales involved. Presumably the density of the foveal center depends on the number of of saccades allowed by the inference process, as well as the size of the target sub-images, and also has an impact on the overall classification accuracy.

Why does the classification error rate of dataset 2 remain stubbornly at 24%? This seems so high that the model may not be working the way we’d like it to. It seems that the overall argument of the paper pre-supposes that the model can be trained to be a good classifier. If there are other training strategies or other models that work better and differently, then it raises the question of why do our eyes and visual cortex not work more like *those ones* if evolutionary pressures are applying the same pressure as our training objective.

Why does the model with zooming powers out-do the translation-only model on dataset 1 (where all target images are the same size) and tie the translation-only model dataset 2 (where the target images have different sizes, for which the zooming model should be tailor-made?). Between this strange tie and the high classification rate on Dataset 2, I wonder if maybe one or both models isn’t being trained to its potential, which would undermine the overall claim.

Comparing this model to other attention models (e.g. spatial transformer networks, DRAW) would be irrelevant to what I take to be the main point of the paper, but it would address the potential concerns above that training just didn’t go very well, or there was some problem with the model parameterization that could be easily fixed.",,6.0,4.0

114,True,Temporal Ensembling for Semi-Supervised Learning,"This paper presents a semi-supervised technique for “self-ensembling” where the model uses a consensus prediction (computed from previous epochs) as a target to regress to, in addition to the usual supervised learning loss. This has connections to the “dark knowledge” idea, ladder networks work is shown in this paper to be a promising technique for scenarios with few labeled examples (but not only). The paper presents two versions of the idea: one which is computationally expensive (and high variance) in that it needs two passes through the same example at a given step, and a temporal ensembling method that is stabler, cheaper computationally but more memory hungry and requires an extra hyper-parameter. 


My thoughts on this work are mostly positive. The drawbacks that I see are that the temporal ensembling work requires potentially a lot of memory, and non-trivial infrastructure / book-keeping for imagenet-sized experiments. I am quite confused by the Figure 2 / Section 3.4 experiments about tolerance to noisy labels: it’s *very* incredible to me that by making 90% of the labels random one can still train a classifier that is either 30% accurate or ~78% accurate (depending on whether or not temporal ensembling was used). I don’t see how that can happen, basically.

115,True,Temporal Ensembling for Semi-Supervised Learning,"This paper presents a model for semi-supervised learning by encouraging feature invariance to stochastic perturbations of the network and/or inputs.  Two models are described:  One where an invariance term is applied between different instantiations of the model/input a single training step, and a second where invariance is applied to features for the same input point across training steps via a cumulative exponential averaging of the features.  These models evaluated using CIFAR-10 and SVHN, finding decent gains of similar amounts in each case.  An additional application is also explored at the end, showing some tolerance to corrupted labels as well.

The authors also discuss recent work by Sajjadi &al that is very similar in spirit, which I think helps corroborate the findings here.

My largest critique is it would have been nice to see applications on larger datasets as well.  CIFAR and SVHN are fairly small test cases, though adequate for demonstration of the idea.  For cases of unlabelled data especially, it would be good to see tests with on the order of 1M+ data samples, with 1K-10K labeled, as this is a common case when labels are missing.

On a similar note, data augmentations are restricted to only translations and (for CIFAR) horizontal flips.  While ""standard,"" as the paper notes, more augmentations would have been interesting to see --- particularly since the model is designed explicitly to take advantage of random sampling.  Some more details might also pop up, such as the one the paper mentions about handling horizontal flips in different ways between the two model variants.  Rather than restrict the system to a particular set of augmentations, I think it would be interesting to push it further, and see how its performance behaves over a larger array of augmentations and (even fewer) numbers of labels.

Overall, this seems like a simple approach that is getting decent results, though I would have liked to see more and larger experiments to get a better sense for its performance characteristics.



Smaller comment: the paper mentions ""dark knowledge"" a couple times in explaining results, e.g. bottom of p.6.  This is OK for a motivation, but in analyzing the results I think it may be possible to have something more concrete.  For instance, the consistency term encourages feature invariance to the stochastic sampling more strongly than would a classification loss alone.

116,True,Temporal Ensembling for Semi-Supervised Learning,"This work explores taking advantage of the stochasticity of neural network outputs under randomized augmentation and regularization techniques to provide targets for unlabeled data in a semi-supervised setting. This is accomplished by either applying stochastic augmentation and regularization on a single image multiple times per epoch and encouraging the outputs to be similar (Π-model) or by keeping a weighted average of past epoch outputs and penalizing deviations of current network outputs from this running mean (temporal ensembling). The core argument is that these approaches produce ensemble predictions which are likely more accurate than the current network and are thus good targets for unlabeled data. Both approaches seem to work quite well on semi-supervised tasks and some results show that they are almost unbelievably robust to label noise.

The paper is clearly written and provides sufficient details to reproduce these results in addition to providing a public code base. The core idea of the paper is quite interesting and seems to result in higher semi-supervised accuracy than prior work. I also found the attention to and discussion of the effect of different choices of data augmentation to be useful.	

I am a little surprised that a standard supervised network can achieve 30% accuracy on SVHN given 90% random training labels. This would only give 19% correctly labeled data (9% by chance + 10% unaltered). I suppose the other 81% would not provide a consistent training signal such that it is possible, but it does seem quite unintuitive. I tried to look through the github for this experiment but it does not seem to be included. 

As for the resistance of Π-model and temporal ensembling to this label noise, I find that somewhat more believable given the large weights placed on the consistency constraint for this task. The authors should really include discussion of w(t) in the main paper. Especially because the tremendous difference in w_max in the incorrect label tolerance experiment (10x for Π-model and 100x for temporal ensembling from the standard setting).

Could the authors comment towards the scalability for larger problems? For ImageNet, you would need to store around 4.8 gigs for the temporal ensembling method or spend 2x as long training with Π-model.

Can the authors discuss sensitivity of this approach to the amount and location of dropout layers in the architecture?

Sequence auto-encoder based features are considered, and random perturbation, feature interpolation, and extrapolation based augmentation are evaluated. On three sequence classification tasks and on MNIST and CIFAR-10, it is shown that augmentation in feature space, specifically extrapolation based augmentation, results in good accuracy gains w.r.t. authors baseline.

My main questions and suggestions for further strengthening the paper are:

a) The proposed data augmentation approach is applied to a learnt auto-encoder based feature space termed ‘context vector’ in the paper.  The context vectors are then augmented and used as input to train classification models. Have the authors considered applying their feature space augmentation idea directly to the classification model during training, and applying it to potentially many layers of the model?  Also, have the authors considered convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures as well for feature space augmentation?  CNNs are now the state-of-the-art in many image and sequence classification task, it would be very valuable to see the impact of the proposed approach in that model.

b) When interpolation or extrapolation based augmentation was being applied, did the authors also consider utilizing nearby samples from competing classes as well?  Especially in case of extrapolation based augmentation it will be interesting to check if the extrapolated features are closer to competing classes than original ones.

c) With random interpolation or nearest neighbor interpolation based augmentation the accuracy seems to degrade pretty consistently.  This is counter-intuitive.  Do the authors have explanation for why the accuracy degraded with interpolation based augmentation?

d) The results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 are inconclusive.  For instance the error rate on CIFAR-10 is well below 10% these days, so I think it is hard to draw conclusions based on error rates above 30%.  For MNIST it is surprising to see that data augmentation in the input space substantially degrades the accuracy (1.093% -> 1.477%).

Clarity is a major issue, but from an initial version that was constructive and better read by a computer than a human, the author proposed a hugely improved later version. This original, technically accurate (within what I understood) and thought provoking paper is worth publishing.

The preliminary results do not tell us yet if the highly complex graph-based differentiable memory has more learning or generalization capacity than other approaches. The performance on the bAbI task is comparable to the best memory networks, but still worse than more traditional rule induction (see ",,9.0,3.0
126,True,Learning Graphical State Transitions,"The paper proposes an extension of the Gated Graph Sequence Neural Network by including in this model the ability to produce complex graph transformations. The underlying idea is to propose a method that will be able build/modify a graph-structure as an internal representation for solving a problem, and particularly for solving question-answering problems in this paper. The author proposes 5 different possible differentiable transformations that will be learned on a training set, typically in a supervised fashion where the state of the graph is given at each timestep. A particular occurence of the model is presented that takes a sequence as an input a iteratively update an internal graph state to a final prediction, and which can be applied for solving QA tasks (e.g BaBi) with interesting results.

The approach  in this paper is really interesting since the proposed model is able to maintain a representation of its current state as a complex graph, but still keeping the property of being differentiable and thus easily learnable through gradient-descent techniques. It can be seen as a succesfull attempt to mix continuous and symbolic representations. It moreover seems more general that the recent attempts made to add some 'symbolic' stuffs in differentiable models (Memory networks, NTM, etc...) since the shape of the state is not fixed here and can evolve. My main concerns is about the way the model is trained i.e by providing the state of the graph at each timestep which can be done for particular tasks (e.g Babi) only, and cannot be the solution for more complex problems. My other concern is about the whole content of the paper that would perhaps best fit a journal format and not a conference format, making the article still difficult to read due to its density.

The proposed approach uses only weak supervision signals to learn the parameters of the model. Unlike in traditional approaches, where the problem is solved by semantically parsing a natural language query into logical forms and executing those logical forms over the given data base, the proposed approach trains a neural network in an end-to-end manner which goes directly from the natural language query to the final answer obtained by processing the data base. This is achieved by formulating a collection of operations to be performed over the data base as continuous operations, the distributions over which is learnt using the now-standard soft attention mechanisms. The model is validated on the smallish WikiTableQuestions dataset, where the authors show that a single model performs worse than the approach which uses the traditional Semantic Parsing technique. However an ensemble of 15 models (trained in a variety of ways) results in comparable performance to the state of the art.

However, there is insufficient empirical evidence to demonstrate the benefit and generality of the proposed method. An apple to apple comparison to previous RL framework that doesn't model information gain is missing. For example, the cluttered MNIST experiment tried to compare against Mnih et al.

* The writing is pretty clear.  I basically felt like I could replicate much of what they did from their paper descriptions.

* The evaluation of the success of these ideas, as compared to other possible approaches, or as compared to human performance on similar tasks, is extremely cursory. 

* The specific tasks that they try are quite simple.   I really don't know whether their approach is better than a bunch of simpler things on these tasks.   

Taking these two cons together, it feels like the authors basically get the implementation done and working somewhat, and then just wrote up the paper.  (I know how it feels to be under a deadline without a complete set of results.)   If the authors had used their approach to solve an obviously hard problem that previously was completely unsolved, even the type of cursory evaluation level chosen here would have been fine.  Or if they had done a very thorough evaluation of a bunch of standard models on each task (and humans too, ideally), and compared their model to those results, that would have been great.

134,False,Towards Information-Seeking Agents,"This paper proposes a setting to learn models that will seek information (e.g., by asking question) in order to solve a given task. They introduce a set of tasks that were designed for that goal. They show that it is possible to train models to solve these tasks with reinforcement learning.

One key motivation for the tasks proposed in this work are the existence of games like 20Q or battleships where an agent needs to ask questions to solve a given task. It is quite surprising that the authors do not actually consider these games as potential tasks to explore (beside the Hangman). It is also not completely clear how the tasks have been selected. A significant amount of work has been dedicated in the past to understand the property of games like 20Q (e.g., Navarro et al., 2010) and how humans solve them.  It would interesting to see how the tasks proposed in this work distinguish themselves from the ones studied in the existing literature, and how humans would perform on them.  In particular, Cohen & Lake, 2016m have recently studied the 20 questions games in their paper “Searching large hypothesis spaces by asking questions” where they both evaluate the performance of humans and computer. I believe that this paper would really benefits from a similar study.

Developing the ability of models to actively seek for information to solve a task is a very interesting but challenging problem. In this paper, all of the  tasks require the agent to select a questions from a finite set of clean and informative possibilities. This allows a simpler analysis of how a given agent may perform but at the cost of a reducing the level of noise that would appear in more realistic settings.

This paper also show that by using a relatively standard mix of deep learning models and reinforcement learning, they are able to train agents that can solve these tasks in the way it was intended to. This validates their empirical setting but also may exhibit some of the limitation of their approach; using relatively toy-ish settings with perfect information and a fixed number of questions may be too simple. 

While it is interesting to see that their agent are able to perform well on all of their tasks, the absence of baselines limit the conclusions we can draw from these experiments. For example in the Hangman experiment, it seems that the frequency based model obtains promising performance. It would interesting to see how good are baselines that may use the co-occurrence of letters or the frequency of character n-grams.


Overall, this paper explores a very interesting direction of research and propose a set of promising tasks to test the capability of a model to learn from asking question. However, the current analysis of the tasks is a bit limited, and it is hard to draw any conclusion from them. It would be good if the paper would focus more on how humans perform on these tasks, on strong simple baselines and on more tasks related to natural language (since it is one of the motivation of this work) rather than on solving them with relatively sophisticated models.

135,True,Frustratingly Short Attention Spans in Neural Language Modeling,"The paper presents an investigation of various neural language models designed to query context information from their recent history using an attention mechanism. The authors propose to separate the attended vectors into key, value and prediction parts. The results suggest that this helps performance. The authors also found that a simple model which which concatenates recent activation vectors performs at a similar level as the more complicated attention-based models.

The experimental methodology seems sound in general. I do have some issues with the way the dimensionality of the vectors involved in the attention-mechanism is chosen. While it’s good that the hidden layer sizes are adapted to ensure similar numbers of trainable parameters for all the models, this doesn’t control for the fact that key/value/prediction vectors of a higher dimensionality may simply work better regardless of whether their dimensions are dedicated to one particular task or used together. This separation clearly saves parameters but there could also be benefits of having some overlap of information assuming that vectors that lead to similar predictions may also be required in similar contexts for example. Some tasks may also require more dimensions than others and the explicit separation prevents the model from discovering and exploiting this. 

While memory augmented RNNs and RNNs with attention mechanisms are not new, some of these architectures had not yet been applied to language modeling. Similarly (and as acknowledged by the authors), the strategy of separating key and value functionality has been proposed before, but not in the context of natural language modeling. I’m not sure about the novelty of the proposed n-gram RNN because I recall seeing similar architectures before but I understand that novelty was not the point of that architecture as it mainly serves as a proof of the lack of ability of the more complicated architectures to do better. In that sense I do consider it an inventive baseline that could be used in future work to test the ability of other models that claim to exploit long-term dependencies. 

The exact computation of the representation h_t was initially not that clear to me (the terms hidden and output can be ambiguous at times) but besides this, the paper is quite clear and generally well-written.

The results in this paper are important because they show that learning long-term dependencies is not a solved problem by any means. The authors provide a very nice comparison to prior results and the fact that their n-gram RNN is often at least competitive with far more complicated approaches is a clear indication that some of those methods may not capture as much context information as previously thought. The success of the separation of key/value/prediction functionality in attention-based system is also noteworthy although I think this is something that needs to be investigated more thoroughly (i.e., with more control for hyperparameter choices). 


Pros:
Impressive and also interesting results.
Good comparison with earlier work.
The n-gram RNN is an interesting baseline.

The relation between the attention-mechanism type and the number of hidden units weakens the claim that the key/value/prediction separation is the reason for the increase in performance somewhat.

The results over the Wikipedia corpus are interesting and feature a wide variety of different model types. This is where the models suggested in the paper are strongest. The same models run over the CBT dataset show a comparable but less convincing demonstration of the variations between the models.

The authors also released their Wikipedia corpus already. Having inspected it I consider it a positive and interesting contribution.

Performing an analysis based upon easily accessed information, such as when the same token reappears again or average sentence length, may be useful as an approximation for the length that an attention window may prefer.

There are a few choices in this work which I do not understand:

Why wait until the end of the episode to update your reinforce policy (algorithm 2), but train your actor critic at each step (algorithm 3)? You say REINFORCE has high variance, which is true, but does not mean it cannot be trained at each step (unless you have some experiments that suggest otherwise, and if so they should be included or mentionned in the paper).

Similarly, why not train REINFORCE with the same reward as your Actor-Critic model? And vice-versa? You claim several times that a limitation of REINFORCE is that you need to wait for the episode to be over, but considering your data is i.i.d., you can make your episode be anything from a single training step, one D_t, to the whole multi-epoch training procedure.


I have a few qualms with the experimental setting:
- is Figure 2 obtained from a single (i.e. one per setup) experiment? From different initial weights? If so, there is no proper way of knowing whether results are chance or not! This is a serious concern for me.
- with most state-of-the-art work using optimization methods such as Adam and RMSProp, is it surprising that they were not experimented with.
- it is not clear what the learning rates are; how fast should the RL part adapt to the SL part? Its not clear that this was experimented with at all.
- the environment, i.e. the target network being trained, is not stationnary at all. It would have been interesting to measure how much the policy changes as a function of time. Figure 3, could both be the result of the policy adapting, or of the policy remaining fixed and the features changing (which could indicate a failure of the policy to adapt).
- in fact it is not really adressed in the paper that the environment is non-stationary, given the current setup, the distribution of features will change as the target network progresses. This has an impact on optimization.
- how is the ""pseudo-validation"" data, target to the policy, chosen? It should be a subset of the training data. The second paragraph of section 3.2 suggests something of the sort, but then your algorithms suggest that the same data is used to train both the policies and the networks, so I am unsure of which is what.

147,True,Do Deep Convolutional Nets Really Need to be Deep and Convolutional?,"This paper aims to investigate the question if shallow non-convolutional networks can be as affective as deep convolutional ones for image classification, given that both architectures use the same number of parameters. 
To this end the authors conducted a series of experiments on the CIFAR10 dataset.
They find that there is a significant performance gap between the two approaches, in favour of deep CNNs. 
The experiments are well designed and involve a distillation training approach, and the results are presented in a comprehensive manner.
They also observe (as others have before) that student models can be shallower than the teacher model from which they are trained for comparable performance.

My take on these results is that they suggest that using (deep) conv nets is more effective, since this model class encodes a form of a-prori or domain knowledge that images exhibit a certain degree of translation invariance in the way they should be processed for high-level recognition tasks. The results are therefore perhaps not quite surprising, but not completely obvious either.

An interesting point on which the authors comment only very briefly is that among the non-convolutional architectures the ones using 2 or 3 hidden layers outperform those with 1, 4 or 5 hidden layers. Do you have an interpretation / hypothesis of why this is the case? It  would be interesting to discuss the point a bit more in the paper.

It was not quite clear to me why were the experiments were limited to use  30M parameters at most. None of the experiments in Figure 1 seem to be saturated. Although the performance gap between CNN and MLP is large, I think it would be worthwhile to push the experiment further for the final version of the paper.

The authors state in the last paragraph that they expect shallow nets to be relatively worse in an ImageNet classification experiment. 
Could the authors argue why they think this to be the case? 
One could argue that the much larger training dataset size could compensate for shallow and/or non-convolutional choices of the architecture. 
Since MLPs are universal function approximators, one could understand architecture choices as expressions of certain priors over the function space, and in a large-data regimes such priors could be expected to be of lesser importance.
This issue could for example be examined on ImageNet when varying the amount of training data.
Also, the much higher resolution of ImageNet images might have a non-trivial impact on the CNN-MLP comparison as compared to the results established on the CIFAR10 dataset.

Experiments on a second data set would also help to corroborate the findings, demonstrating to what extent such findings are variable across datasets.

The paper proposes to a new neural network architecture. The layer weights of a classical network are computed as a function of a latent representation associated with the layer. Two instances are presented (i) a CNN where each layer weight is computed from a lower dimensional layer embedding vector; (ii) an RNN where each layer weight is computed from a secondary RNN state.

*** Review Summary ***

Pros: 
- I like the idea of bringing multiplicative RNNs and their predecessors back into the spotlight. 
- LM and MT results are excellent.

Cons:  
- The paper could be better written. It is too long for the conference format and need refocussing. 
- On related work, the relation with multiplicative RNN and their generic tensor product predecessor (Order 2 networks, wrt C. Lee Giles definition) should be mentioned in the related work section and the differences with earlier research need to be explained and motivated (by the way it is better to say that something is revisiting an old idea or training it at modern scale/on modern tasks than ommitting it).
- on focus, it is not clear if your goal is to achieve better performance or more compact networks. In the RNN section you lean toward the former, in the CNN section you seem to lean toward the latter.

I would suggest to make the paper shorter and clearer possibly leaving the CNN results for latter publication. The relation with multiplicative/order 2 networks and eventual differences need to be explained.

*** Detailed Review ***

Multiplicative networks are an extremely powerfull architecture and bringing them back into the spotlight is excellent. This paper has excellent results but suffer poor presentation, lack of a clear focus. It spends time on details and ommit important points. In its current form, it is much too long to long and his not self contained without the appendices.

Spending more time on multiplicative RNNs, order 2 networks at the begining of the paper would be excellent. This will let you highlight the difference between this paper and earlier work. It would also be necessary to spend a little time on why multiplicative RNN were less used than gated RNN: it seems that the optimization problem their training involve is tricker and it would be helpful to explain whether you had a harder time tweaking optimization parameters or whether you needed longer training sessions compared to LSTMs, regular CNN. On name, I am not sure that ""hypernetwork"" help the reader understand better what the proposed architecture compared to multiplicative interactions.

In section 3.2, you seem to imply that there are different settings of hypernetworks that allow to vary from an RNN to a CNN, this is not clear to me, maybe you could show how this would work on a simple temporal problem with equations. 

The work on CNN and RNN are rather disconnected to me: for CNN, you seem to be interested in a low rank structure of the weights, showing that similar performance can be achieved with less weights. It is not clear to me why to pursue that goal. Do you expect speedups? less memory for embedded applications? In that case you should compare with alternative strategies, e.g. model compression (Caruana et al 2006, aka Dark Knowledge, Hinton et al 2014) or hashed networks (Chen et al 2015). 

For RNN, you seem to target better perplexity/BLEU and model compactness is not a priority. Instead of making the weights have a simpler structure, you make them richer, i.e. dependent over time. It seems in that case models might be bigger and take longer to train. You might want to comment on training time, inference time, memory requirement in that case, as you highlight it might be an important goal in the CNN section. Overall, I am not sure it helps to have this mixed message. I would rather see the paper fit in the conference format with the RNN results alone and a clearer explanation and defers the publications of the CNN results when a proper comparison with memory concerned methods is performed.

Some of the discussions are not clear to me, I am not sure what message the reader should get from Figure 2 or from the discussion on saturation statistics (p10, Figure 5). Similarly, I am not sure if Figure 4 is showing anything: everything should change more drastically at word boundaries even in a regular LSTM (states, gates units should look very different before/after a space); without such a comparison it is hard to see if this is unique to your network.

The results on handwriting generation are harder to compare for me. Log-loss are hard to understand, I have no sense whether the difference between models is significant (what would be the variance in this metric under boostrap sampling of the training set?). I am not sold either on qualitative metric were human can assess quality but human cannot evaluate if the network is repeating the training set. Did you thing at precision/recall metric for ink, possibly with some spatial tolerance ? (e.g. evaluation of segmentation tasks in vision).

The MT experiments are insufficiently discussed in the main text.

Overall, I would suggest to make the paper shorter and clearer possibly leaving the CNN results for latter publication. You need to properly discuss the relation to multiplicative/order 2 networks and highlight the differences. Unclear discussion can be eliminated to make the experimental setup and the results presentation clearer in the main text.

149,True,HyperNetworks,"A well known limitation in deep neural networks is that the same parameters are typically used for all examples, even though different examples have very different characteristics.  For example, recognizing animals will likely require different features than categorizing flowers.  Using different parameters for different types of examples has the potential to greatly reduce underfitting.  This can be seen in recent results with generative models, where image quality is much better for less diverse datasets.  However, it is difficult to use different parameters for different examples because we typically train using minibatches, which relies on using the same parameters for all examples in a minibatch (i.e. doing matrix multiplies in a fully-connected network).  

The hypernetworks paper cleverly proposes to get around this problem by adapting different ""parameters"" for different time steps in recurrent networks and different.  The basic insight is that a minibatch will always include many different examples from the same time step or spatial position, so there is no computational issue involved with using different ""parameters"".  In this paper, the ""parameters"" are modified for different positions based on the output from a hypernetwork which conditions on the time step.  Hypothetically, this hypernetwork could also condition on other features that are shared by all sequences in the minibatch.  

I expect this method to become standard for training RNNs, especially where the length of the sequences is the same during the training and testing phases.  Penn Treebank is a highly competitive baseline, so the SOTA result reported here is impressive.  The experiments on convolutional networks are less experimentally impressive.  I suspect that the authors were aiming to achieve state of the art results here but settled with achieving a reduction in the number of parameters.  It might even be worthwhile to consider a synthetic experiment where two completely different types of image are appended (i.e. birds on the left and flowers on the right) and show that the hypernetwork helps in this situation.  It may be the case that for convnets, the cases where hypernetworks help are very specific.  

For RNNs, it seems to be the case that explicitly changing the nature of the computation depending on the position in the sequence greatly improves generalization.  While a usual RNN could learn to store a counter (indicating the position in the sequence), the hypernetwork could be a more efficient way to add capacity.  

Applications to time series forecasting and modeling could be an interesting area for future work.  ",,9.0,4.0

Unfortunately, as the results show, the authors could not get better results with less parameters.
However, the proposed structure with even more number of parameters shows significant gain e.g. in LM.

The paper should be reorganized, and shortened. It is sometimes difficult to follow and sometimes inconsistent.
E.g.: the weights of the feedforward network depend only on an embedding vector (see also my previous comments on linear bottlenecks), whereas in recurrent network the generated weights also depend on the input observation or its hidden representation.

The authors demonstrated that the total number of model parameters could be smaller while achieving competitive results on the image classification task.

--pros

This work demonstrates that it is possible to generate the neural network model parameters using another network that can achieve competitive results by a few relative large scale experiments. The idea itself is very inspiring, and the experiments are very solid.

--cons

The paper would be much stronger if it was more focused. In particular, it is unclear what is the key advantage of this hypernetwork approach. It is argued that in the paper that can achieve competitive results using smaller number of trainable model parameters. However, in the running time, the computational complexity is the same as the standard main network for static networks, such as ConvNet, and the computational cost is even larger for dynamic networks such as LSTMs. The improvements of hyperLSTMs over conventional LSTM and its variants seem mainly come from increasing the number of model parameters.

--minor question,

 The ConvNet and LSTM used in the experiments do not have a large softmax layer. For most of the word-level tasks for either LM or MT, the softmax layer could be more than 100K. Is it going to be challenging for the hyperNetwork generate large number of weights for that case, and is it going to slowing the training down significantly?

Paper summary:
This work proposes a new algorithm to generate k-adversarial images by modifying a small fraction of the image pixels and without requiring access to the classification network weight.


Review summary:
The topic of adversarial images generation is of both practical and theoretical interest. This work proposes a new approach to the problem, however the paper suffers from multiple issues. It is too verbose (spending long time on experiments of limited interest); disorganized (detailed description of the main algorithm in sections 4 and 5, yet a key piece is added in the experimental section 6); and more importantly the resulting experiments are of limited interest to the reader, and the main conclusions are left unclear.
This looks like an interesting line of work that has yet to materialize in a good document, it would need significant re-writing to be in good shape for ICLR.


Pros:
* Interesting topic
* Black-box setup is most relevant
* Multiple experiments
* Shows that with flipping only 1~5% of pixels, adversarial images can be created


Cons:
* Too long, yet key details are not well addressed
* Some of the experiments are of little interest
* Main experiments lack key measures or additional baselines
* Limited technical novelty




Quality: the method description and experimental setup leave to be desired. 


Clarity: the text is verbose, somewhat formal, and mostly clear; but could be improved by being more concise.


Originality: I am not aware of another work doing this exact same type of experiments. However the approach and results are not very surprising.


Significance: the work is incremental, the issues in the experiments limit potential impact of this paper.


Specific comments:
* I would suggest to start by making the paper 30%~40% shorter. Reducing the text length, will force to make the argumentation and descriptions more direct, and select only the important experiments.
* Section 4 seems flawed. If the modified single pixel can have values far outside of the [LB, UB] range; then this test sample is clearly outside of the training distribution; and thus it is not surprising that the classifier misbehaves (this would be true for most classifiers, e.g. decision forests or non-linear SVMs). These results would be interesting only if the modified pixel is clamped to the range [LB, UB].
* [LB, UB] is never specified, is it ? How does p = 100, compares to [LB, UB] ? To be of any use, p should be reported in proportion to [LB, UB]
* The modification is done after normalization, is this realistic ? 
* Alg 2, why not clamping to [LB, UB] ?
* Section 6, “implementing algorithm LocSearchAdv”, the text is unclear on how p is adjusted; new variables are added. This is confusion.
* Section 6, what happens if p is _not_ adjusted ? What happens if a simple greedy random search is used (e.g. try 100 times a set of 5 random pixels with value 255) ?
* Section 6, PTB is computed over all pixels ? including the ones not modified ? why is that ? Thus LocSearchAdv PTB value is not directly comparable to FGSM, since it intermingles with #PTBPixels (e.g. “in many cases far less average perturbation” claim).
* Section 6, there is no discussion on the average number of model evaluations. This would be equivalent to the number of requests made to a system that one would try to fool. This number is important to claim the “effectiveness” of such black box attacks. Right now the text only mentions the upper bound of 750 network evaluations. 
* How does the number of network evaluations changes when adjusting or not adjusting p during the optimization ?
* Top-k is claimed as a main point of the paper, yet only one experiment is provided. Please develop more, or tune-down the claims.
* Why is FGSM not effective for batch normalized networks ? Has this been reported before ? Are there other already published techniques that are effective for this scenario ? Comparing to more methods would be interesting.
* If there is little to note from section 4 results, what should be concluded from section 6 ? That is possible to obtain good results by modifying only few pixels ? What about selecting the “top N” largest modified pixels from FGSM ? Would these be enough ? Please develop more the baselines, and the specific conclusions of interest.


Minor comments:
* The is an abuse of footnotes, most of them should be inserted in the main text.
* I would suggest to repeat twice or thrice the meaning of the main variables used (e.g. p, r, LB, UB)
* Table 1,2,3 should be figures
* Last line of first paragraph of section 6 is uninformative.

153,False,Simple Black-Box Adversarial Perturbations for Deep Networks,"The paper presents a method for generating adversarial input images for a convolutional neural network given only black box access (ability to obtain outputs for chosen inputs, but no access to the network parameters).  However, the notion of adversarial example is somewhat weakened in this setting: it is k-misclassification (ensuring the true label is not a top-k output), instead of misclassification to any desired target label.

A similar black-box setting is examined in Papernot et al. (2016c).  There, black-box access is used to train a substitute for the network, which is then attacked.  Here, black-box access in instead exploited via local search.  The input is perturbed, the resulting change in output scores is examined, and perturbations that push the scores towards k-misclassification are kept.

A major concern with regard to novelty is that this greedy local search procedure is analogous to gradient descent; a numeric approximation (observe change in output for corresponding change in input) is used instead of backpropagation, since one does not have access to the network parameters.  As such, the greedy local search algorithm itself, to which the paper devotes a large amount of discussion, is not surprising and the paper is fairly incremental in terms of technical novelty.

154,True,Recurrent Hidden Semi-Markov Model,"This paper proposes a novel and interesting way to tackle the difficulties of performing inference atop HSMM. The idea of using an embedded bi-RNN to approximate the posterior is a reasonable and clever idea. 

That being said, I think two aspects may need further improvement:
(1) An explanation as to why a bi-RNN can provide more accurate approximations than other modeling choices (e.g. structured mean field that uses a sequential model to formulate the variational distribution) is needed. I think it would make the paper stronger if the authors can explain in an intuitive way why this modeling choice is better than some other natural choices (in addition to empirical verification).
(2) The real world datasets seem to be quite small (e.g. less than 100 sequences). Experimental results reported on larger datasets may also strengthen the paper.",,7.0,4.0
155,True,Recurrent Hidden Semi-Markov Model,"This paper presents a novel model for unsupervised segmentation and classification of time series data.  A recurrent hidden semi-markov model is proposed.  This extends regular hidden semi-markov models to include a recurrent neural network (RNN) for observations.  Each latent class has its own RNN for modeling observations for that category.  Further, an efficient training procedure based on a variational approximation.  Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for modeling synthetic and real time series data.

This is an interesting and novel paper.  The proposed method is a well-motivated combination of duration modeling HMMs with state of the art observation models based on RNNs.  The combination alleviates shortcomings of standard HSMM variants in terms of the simplicity of the emission probability.  The method is technically sound and demonstrated to be effective.

It would be interesting to see how this method compares quantitatively against CRF-based methods (e.g. Ammar, Dyer, and Smith NIPS 2014).  CRFs can model more complex data likelihoods, though as noted in the response phase there are still limitations.  Regardless, I think the merits of using RNNs for the class-specific generative models are clear.

The analysis of the effects of this added latency is thorough. The systems analysis of the algorithm is extensive. 

One caveat is that the performance figures in Table 3 are hard to compare since the protocols vary so much. I understand that DeepMind didn't provide reproducible code for A3C, but I gather from the comment that the authors have re-implemented vanilla A3C as well, in which case it would be good to show what this reimplementation of A3C achieves in the same setting used by DM, and in the setting of the experiment conducted using GA3C (1 day). It would be good to clarify in the text that the experimental protocol differed (top 5 out of 50 vs single run), and clarify why the discrepancy, even if the answer is that the authors didn't have time / resources to reproduce the same protocol. A bit more care would go a long way to establishing that indeed, there is no price to pay for the approximations that were made.

I applaud the authors for open-sourcing the code, especially since there is a relative shortage of properly tested open-source implementations in that general area, and getting these algorithms right is non-trivial.

The system is compared to the authors' own implementation of A3C as well as to published reference scores.

The automatic performance tuning strategy is also really nice to see.

160,False,Adversarial examples for generative models,"Comments: 

""This contrasts to adversarial attacks on classifiers, where any inspection of the inputs will reveal the original bytes the adversary supplied,
which often have telltale noise""

Is this really true?  If it were the case, wouldn't it imply that training ""against"" adversarial examples should easily make a classifier robust to adversarial examples (if they all have a telltale noise)?  

Pros: 
  -The question of whether adversarial examples exist in generative models, and indeed how the definition of ""adversarial example"" carries over is an interesting one.  
  -Finding that a certain type of generative model *doesn't have* adversarial examples would be a really significant result, finding that generative models have adversarial examples would also be a worth negative result.  
  -The adversarial examples in figures 5 and 6 seem convincing, though they seem much more overt and noisy than the adversarial examples on MNIST shown in (Szegedy 2014).  Is this because it's actually harder to find adversarial examples in these types of generative models?  

Issues: 
  -Paper is significantly over length at 13 pages.  
  -The beginning of the paper should more clearly motivate its purpose.  
  -Paper has ""generative models"" in the title but as far as I can tell the whole paper is concerned with autoencoder-type models.  This is kind of annoying because if someone wanted to consider adversarial attacks on, say, autoregressive models, they might be unreasonably burdened by having to explain how they're distinct from a paper called ""adversarial examples for generative models"".

Specifically, three methods are considered: classification-based adversaries which uses a classifier on top of the hidden code, VAE loss which directly uses the VAE loss and the ""latent attack"" which finds adversarial perturbation in the input so as to match the latent representation of a target input.

I think the problem that this paper considers is potentially useful and interesting to the community. To the best of my knowledge this is the first paper that considers adversarial examples for generative models. As I pointed out in my pre-review comments, there is also a concurrent work of ""Adversarial Images for Variational Autoencoders"" that essentially proposes the same ""latent attack"" idea of this paper with both L2 distance and KL divergence.

Novelty/originality: I didn't find the ideas of this paper very original. All the proposed three attacks are well-known and standard methods that here are applied to a new problem and this paper does not develop *novel* algorithms for attacking specifically *generative models*. However I still find it interesting to see how these standard methods compare in this new problem domain.

The clarity and presentation of the paper is very unsatisfying. The first version of the paper proposes the ""classification-based adversaries"" and reports only negative results. In the second set of revisions, the core idea of the paper changes and almost an entirely new paper with a new co-author is submitted and the idea of ""latent attack"" is proposed which works much better than the ""classification-based adversaries"".

- The attention terminology is misleading in the paper. The proposed method really just try to distill the summed squared(or other statistics e.g. summed lp norm) of  activations in a hidden feature map.

Attention transfer is performed by minimising the l2 distance between the teacher/student attention maps at different layers, in addition to minimising the classification loss and optionally a knowledge distillation term.
Authors define several activation based attentions (sum of absolute feature values raise at the power p or max of values raised at the power p). They also propose a gradient based attention (derivative of the Loss w.r.t. inputs). 

They evaluate their approaches on several datasets (CIFAR, Cub/Scene, Imagenet) showing that attention transfers  does help improving the student network test performance.  However, the student networks performs worst than the teacher, even with attention.

Few remarks/questions:
- in section 3 authors  claim that networks with higher accuracy have a higher spatial correlation between the object and the attention map. While Figure 4 is compelling, it would be nice to have quantitative results showing that as well.
- how did you choose the hyperparameter values, it would be nice to see what is the impact of $\beta$.
- it would be nice to report teacher train and validation loss in Figure 7 b)
- from the experiments, it is not clear what at the pros/cons of the different attention maps
- AT does not lead to better result than the teacher. However, the student networks have less parameters. It would be interesting to characterise the corresponding speed-up. If you keep the same architecture between the student and the teacher, is there any benefit to the attention transfer?

In summary:
Pros:
- Clearly written and well motivated.
- Consistent improvement of the student with attention compared to the student alone.

- Students have worst performances than the teacher models.

165,False,Online Structure Learning for Sum-Product Networks with Gaussian Leaves,"The authors contribute an algorithm for building sum-product networks (SPNs) from data, assuming a Gaussian distribution for all dimensions of the observed data.  Due to the restricted structure of the SPN architecture, building a valid architecture that is tailored to a specific dataset is not an obvious exercise, and so structure-learning algorithms are employed.  For Gaussian distributed observations, the authors state that the previous state of the art is to chose a random SPN that satisfies the completeness and decomposibility constraints that SPNs must observe, and to then learn the parameters (as done in Jaini 2016).  In the contributed manuscript, the algorithm begins with a completely factorized model, and then by passing through the data, builds up more structure, while updating appropriate node statistics to maintain the validity of the SPN.

The above Jaini reference figures heavily into the reading of the paper because it is (to my limited knowledge) the previous work SOTA on SPNs applied to Gaussian distributed data, and also because the authors of the current manuscript compare performance to datasets studied in Jaini et al.  I personally was unfamiliar with most of these datasets, and so have no basis to judge loglikelihoods, given a particular model, as being either good or poor.  Nevertheless, the current manuscript reports results on these datasets that better (5 / 7) than other methods, such as SPNS (constructed randomly), Stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines or Generative Moment Matching networks.

Overall: 
First let me say, I am not really qualified to make a decision on the acceptance or rejection of this manuscript (yet I am forced to make just such a choice) because I am not an expert in SPNs. I was also unfamiliar with the datasets, so I had no intuitive understanding of the algorithms performance, even when viewed as a black-box.  The algorithm is presented without theoretical inspiration or justification.  These latter are by no means a bad thing, but it again gives me little hold onto when evaluating the manuscript.  The manuscript is clearly written, and to my limited knowledge novel, and their algorithm does a good job (5/7) on selected datasets.  

My overall impression is that there isn't very much work here (e.g., much of the text is similar to Jaini, and most of the other experiments are repeated verbatim from Jaini), but again I may be missing something (this manuscript DOES mostly Jaini). I say this mostly because I am unfamiliar with the datasets.  Hopefully my reviewing peers will have enough background to know if the results are impressive or not, and my review should be weighted minimally.

Smallish Problems
I wanted to see nonuniform covariances in the data of the the toy task (Fig 3) for each gaussian component.

The SPN construction method has two obvious hyper parameters, it is important to see how those parameters affect the graph structure. (I submitted this as a pre-review question, to which the authors responded that they would look into this.)",,4.0,1.0
166,False,Online Structure Learning for Sum-Product Networks with Gaussian Leaves,"# Summary
This paper proposes an algorithm to learn the structure of continuous SPNs in a single pass through the data,
basically by ""growing"" the SPN when two variables are correlated.

## NOTE
I am not an expert on SPNs, and can not really judge how impressive the presented results are due to lack of familiarity with the datsets.

# Pro
- This looks like possibly impactful work, proposing a simple and elegant algorithm for learning SPN structure single-pass, rather than just using random structure which has been done in other work in the online settings.

# Con
- The paper is heavily updated between submission deadline and submission of reviews.
- The paper reads like a rush job, sloppily written - at least the first version.
- Comparison to literature is severely lacking; eg ""several automated structure learning techniques have been proposed"" followed by 6 citations but no discussion of any of them, which one is most related, which ideas carry over from the offline setting to this online setting, etc. Also since this work presents both joint structure & *parameter* learning, comparison to the online parameter learning papers (3 cited) would be appreciated, specifically since these prior approaches seem to be more principled with Bayesian Moment Matching in Jaini 2016 for example.
- I do not know enough about SPNs and the datasets to properly judge how strong the results are, but they seem to be a bit underwhelming on the large datasets wrt Random

# Remaining questions after the paper updates
- Table 3: Random structure as baseline ok, but how were the parameters here learned? Your simple running average or with more advanced methods?
- Table 1: you are presenting *positive* average log-likelihood values? This should be an average of log(p<=1) < 0 values? What am I missing here?

I recommend reject mostly because this paper should have been finished and polished at submission time, not at review deadline time.",,4.0,2.0
167,True,Learning to Optimize,"There is a series of somewhat-related papers on learning to optimize for sparse coding and other L1/L2 optimization problems.
Inference in sparse coding is often performed with the Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA). 
ISTA can be viewed as a kind of recurrent net in which the matrices and non-linearities are specified by the reconstruction matrix.
The main idea is to train the matrices in this recurrent net to produce an approximate solution faster than ISTA.

This papers adds to the literature on learning optimizers/algorithms that has gained popularity recently. The authors choose to use the framework of guided policy search at the meta-level to train the optimizers. They also opt to train on random objectives and assess transfer to a few simple tasks.

As pointed below, this is a useful addition.

However, the argument of using RL vs gradients at the meta-level that appears below is not clear or convincing. I urge the authors to run an experiment comparing the two approaches and to present comparative results. This is a very important question, and the scalability of this approach could very well hinge on this fact. Indeed, demonstrating both scaling to large domains and transfer to those domains is the key challenge in this domain.

In summary, the idea is a good one, but the experiments are weak.

170,True,Learning to Optimize,"This paper proposes an approach to learning a custom optimizer for a given class optimization problems. I think in the case of training machine learning algorithms, a class would represent a model like “logistic regression”. The authors cleverly cast this as a reinforcement learning problem and use guided policy search to train a neural network to map the current location and history onto a step direction/magnitude. Overall I think this is a great idea and a very nice contribution to the fast growing meta-learning literature. However, I think that there are some aspects that could be touched on to make this a stronger paper.

My first thought is that the authors claim to train the method to learn the regularities of an entire class of optimization problems, rather than learning to exploit regularities in a given set of tasks. The distinction here is not terribly clear to me. For example, in learning an optimizer for logistic regression, the authors seem to claim that learning on a randomly sampled set of logistic regression problems will allow the model to learn about logistic regression itself. I am not convinced of this, because there is bias in the randomly sampled data itself. From the paper in this case, “The instances are drawn randomly from two multivariate Gaussians with random means and covariances, with half drawn from each.” It seems the optimizer is then trained to optimize instances of logistic regression *given this specific family of training inputs* and not logistic regression problems in general. A simple experiment to prove the method works more generally would be to repeat the existing experiments, but where the test instances are drawn from a completely different distribution. It would be even more interesting to see how this changes as the test distribution deviates further from the training distribution.

Can the authors comment on the choice of architecture used here? Why one layer with 50 hidden units and softplus activations specifically? Why not e.g., 100 units, 2 layers and ReLUs?
Presumably this is to prevent overfitting, but given the limited capacity of the network, how do these results look when the dimensionality of the input space increases beyond 2 or 3?

I would love to see what kind of policy the network learns on e.g., a 2D function using a contour plot. What do the steps look like on a random problem instance when compared to other hand-engineered optimizers?

Overall I think this a really interesting paper with a great methodological contribution. My main concern is that the results may be oversold as the problems are still relatively simple and constrained. However, if the authors can demonstrate that this approach produces robust policies for a very general set of problems then that would be truly spectacular.

Minor notes below.

Section 3.1 should you be using \pi_T^* to denote the optimal policy? You use \pi_t^* and \pi^* currently.

Are the problems here considered noiseless? That is, is the state transition given an action deterministic? It would be very interesting to see this on noisy problems.

This work appeared on arxiv just before we were able to release our learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent paper. 
In our case, we were motivated by neural art and a desire to replace the lBFGS optimizer with a neural Turing machine (both have the same equation forms - see appendix of our arxiv version). In the end, we settled on an LSTM optimizer that is also learned by SGD. 

This paper, on the other hand, uses guided policy search to choose the parameter updates (policy). Importantly, this paper also emphasizes the importance of transfer of optimizers to novel tasks.

This is undoubtedly a timely, good contribution to the learning to learn literature, which has gained great popularity in recent months.",,,
172,True,Learning to Optimize,"I have some questions about the details of your experiments and algorithm. The paper presents a method using Guided Policy Search (GPS) techniques for learning optimization algorithm (\pi). Since the contribution is mainly empirical, convincing experimental analysis is expected. Currently, all of three experiments were conducted on toy datasets. The number of parameters to be optimized is so small (only no more than 10). I suggest you evaluate your method on some standard datasets on middle or large scale network structures. Besides, other popular optimization algorithms, such as Adam, RMSprop, etc. should be compared. 
 
Another point I was wondering is whether your method is suitable for practical use. Both the value and the gradient of the objective function at the most recent H steps (H=25 in the paper) are encoded as state space. Suppose that the dimension of the parameters to be optimized is N, the dimension of the state space would be (1+N)*H. Then they are fed to a one layer network with 50 hidden units to model the policy (\pi), yielding N outputs to update parameters. But in practical scenario, the computational complexity and memory used for optimization algorithm should better not exceed the complexity of the training algorithm. Your policy network takes the gradients of all the parameters as input, which means policy network itself has more parameters to learn than the parameters of the problem of interest.

178,True,An Information-Theoretic Framework for Fast and Robust Unsupervised Learning via Neural Population Infomax,"This is an 18 page paper plus appendix which presents a mathematical derivation for infomax for an actual neural population with noise.  The original Bell & Sejnowski infomax framework only considered the no noise case.  Results are shown for natural image patches and the mnist dataset, which qualitatively resemble results obtained with other methods.

This seems like an interesting and potentially more general approach to unsupervised learning.  However the paper is quite long and it was difficult for me to follow all the twists and turns.  For example the introduction of the hierarchical model was confusing and it took several iterations to understand where this was going.  'Hierarchical' is probably not the right terminology here because it's not like a deep net hierarchy, it's just decomposing the tuning curve function into different parts.  I would recommend that the authors try to condense the paper so that the central message and important steps are conveyed in short order, and then put the more complete mathematical development into a supplementary document.

Also, the authors should look at the work of Karklin & Simoncelli 2011 which is highly related.  They also use an infomax framework for a noisy neural population to derive on and off cells in the retina, and they show the conditions under which orientation selectivity emerges.",,7.0,3.0
179,True,An Information-Theoretic Framework for Fast and Robust Unsupervised Learning via Neural Population Infomax,"This paper presents an information theoretic framework for unsupervised learning. The framework relies on infomax principle, whose goal is to maximize the mutual information between input and output. The authors propose a two-step algorithm for learning in this setting. First, by leveraging an asymptotic approximation to the mutual information, the global objective is decoupled into two subgoals whose solutions can be expressed in closed form. Next, these serve as the initial guess for the global solution, and are refined by the gradient descent algorithm.

While the story of the paper and the derivations seem sound, the clarity and presentation of the material could improve. For example, instead of listing step by step derivation of each equation, it would be nice to first give a high-level presentation of the result and maybe explain briefly the derivation strategy. The very detailed aspects of derivations, which could obscure the underlying message of the result could perhaps be postponed to later sections or even moved to an appendix.

A few questions that the authors may want to clarify:
1. Page 4, last paragraph: ""from above we know that maximizing I(X;R) will result in maximizing I(Y;R) and I(X,Y^U)"". While I see the former holds due to equality in 2.20, the latter is related via a bound in 2.21. Due to the possible gap between I(X;R) and I(X,Y^U), can your claim that maximizing of the former indeed maximizes the latter be true?
2. Paragraph above section 2.2.2: it is stated that, dropout used to prevent overfitting may in fact be regarded as an attempt to reduce the rank of the weight matrix. No further tip is provided why this should be the case. Could you elaborate on that?
3. At the end of page 9: ""we will discuss how to get optimal solution of C for two specific cases"". If I understand correctly, you actually are not guaranteed to get the optimal solution of C in either case, and the best you can guarantee is reaching a local optimum. This is due to the nonconvexity of the constraint 2.80 (quadratic equality). If optimality cannot be guaranteed, please correct the wording accordingly.

181,True,An Information-Theoretic Framework for Fast and Robust Unsupervised Learning via Neural Population Infomax,"My main research interests are in computational neuroscience, information theory, machine learning and deep learning. For those of us who engage in AI related research, we all want to learn from the human brain how to process information to achieve intelligence. For example, deep learning is now said to be brain-like, but also some researchers say that nothing to do with the neuroscience. But one thing is for sure, and that is deep nets learning the brain processing information with hierarchical structure. However, the current advances in neuroscience is of limited role on the inspiration for AI research. 

How do we learn from the brain, learn what? We think we should learn the basic design principles for the information processing in our nervous system. What are the fundamental principles to guide the brain to design these complex structures and neural coding. 
In fact, the principle on energy and information provides a fundamental constraint for the actual nervous systems. The efficient coding hypothesis proposed by Horace Barlow provides a good description of this principle. But how to model this hypothesis, we will encounter great challenges. Because a direct calculation of Shannon's mutual information (MI) is generally a very difficult thing in many cases. 

We first solve the problem of effective approximation for evaluating MI in the context of neural population coding, especially for high-dimensional inputs. Then an fast and robust unsupervised learning algorithm is developed in this paper. With our methods, we have explained some interesting phenomena in neuroscience, which were previously unsolvable in other ways. 
In machine learning and deep learning, this paper is a more fundamental part  that provides the basis for our other works. We have also got a lot of interesting results from other related works we have done or are doing. For example, we use our method to train CNN, RNN and generative model, etc. We can unify supervised learning and unsupervised learning and can completely without the backpropagation algorithm for supervised learning of deep nets. We can also prove that the cost function of SVM (Hinge loss) is a special case of our neural population infomax. For the current deep nets, we need the big data for training, and in our framework, the small data we also can achieve good results.

language. This enables writing a program ""sketch"" (a program with parts left
out), with a hole to be filled in based upon learning from input-output
examples. The main technical development is to start with an abstract machine
for the Forth language, and then to make all of the operations differentiable.
The technique for making operations differentiable is analogous to what is done
in models like Neural Turing Machine and Stack RNN. Special syntax is developed
for specifying holes, which gives the pattern about what data should be read
when filling in the hole, which data should be written, and what the rough
structure of the model that fills the hole should be. Motivation for why one
should want to do this is that it enables composing program sketches with other
differentiable models like standard neural networks, but the experiments focus
on sorting and addition tasks with relatively small degrees of freedom for how
to fill in the holes.

Experimentally, result show that sorting and addition can be learned given
strong sketches.

The aim of this paper is very ambitious: convert a full programming language to
be differentiable, and I admire this ambition. The idea is provocative and I
think will inspire people in the ICLR community.

The main weakness is that the experiments are somewhat trivial and there are no
baselines. I believe that simply enumerating possible values to fill in the
holes would work better, and if that is possible, then it's not clear to me what
is practically gained from this formulation. (The authors argue that the point
is to compose differentiable Forth sketches with neural networks sitting below,
but if the holes can be filled by brute force, then could the underlying neural
network not be separately trained to maximize the probability assigned to any
filling of the hole that produces the correct input-output behavior?)

Related, one thing that is missing, in my opinion, is a more nuanced outlook of
where the authors believe this work is going. Based on the small scale of the
experiments and from reading other related papers in the area, I sense that it
is hard to scale up differentiable forth to large real-world problems. It
would be nice to have more discussion about this, and perhaps even an experiment
that demonstrates a failure case. Is there a problem that is somewhat more
complex than the ones that appear in the paper where the approach does not work?
What has been tried to make it work? What are the failure modes? What are the
challenges that the authors believe need to be overcome to make this work.

They turn the overall too open problem of program induction into a slot filling problem, with a differentiable Forth interpreter, for which one can backprop through  the slots (as they are random variables). The point of having sketches/partial programs is that one can learn more complex programs than starting from scratch (with no prior information). The loss that they optimize (end to end through the program flow) is a L2 (RMSE) of the program memory (at targeted/non-masked adresses) and the desired output. They show that they can learn addition, and bubble sort, both with a Permute (3-way) sketch and with a Compare (2-way) sketch.

The idea of making a language fully differentiable to write partial programs (sketches) and have them completed was previously explored in the  probabilistic programming community and more recently with TerpreT. I think that using Forth (a very simple stack-based language) as the sketch definition language is interesting in itself, as it is between machine code (Neural Turing Machine, Stack RNN, Neural RAM approaches...) and higher level languages (Church, TerpreT, ProbLog...).

I guess Figure 1 is only for mnist and for only two values of p with one particular network architecture, the dataset and empirical setup is not clear.

The convergence is demonstrated only for three dropout values in Figure 2 which may cause an unfair comparison. For instance how does the convergence compare for the best dropout rate after cross-validation (three figures each figure has three results for one method with different dropouts [bests cv result for each one])? Also how is the corresponding validation error and test iterations?  Also only mnist does not have to generalize to other benchmarks.

Figure 3 gives closer results for Adam optimizer, learning rate is not selected with random search or bayesian optimization, learning decay iterations fixed and regularization coefficient is set to a small value without tuning. A slightly better tuning of parameters may close the current gap. Also Nesterov based competitor gives unreasonably worse accuracy compared to recent results which may indicate that this experiment should not be taken into account. 

In Table 2, there is no significant improvement on CIFAR10. The CIFAR100 difference is not significant without including batch normalization variance re-estimation. However there is no result for 'original with BN update' therefore it is not clear whether the BN update helps in general or not. SVHN also does not have result for original with BN update.

There should be baselines with batch normalizations for Figure 1,2 3 to support the claims convincingly.  The main criticism about batch normalization is additional computational cost by giving (Mishkin et al, 2016 ) as reference however this should not be a reason to not to compare the initialization to batch-normalization.  In fact, (Mishkin et al, 2016) performs comparison to batch normalization and also with and without data augmentation with recent state of art architectures.

None of the empirical results have data augmentation. It is not clear if the initialization or  batch normalization update will help or make it worse for that case.

- I'm guessing the correction for dropout variance at test time is not only specific to batch normalization: Standard dropout, in networks without batch normalization, corrects only for the mean at test time (by dividing activations by one minus the dropout probability). This work suggests it would be beneficial to also correct for the variance. Has this been tested?

191,False,Adjusting for Dropout Variance in Batch Normalization and Weight Initialization,"The paper presents an approach for compensating the input/activation variance introduced by dropout in a network. Additionally, a practical inference trick of re-estimating the batch normalization parameters with dropout turned off before testing. 

The authors very well show how dropout influences the input/activation variance and then scale the initial weights accordingly to achieve unit variance which helps in avoiding activation outputs exploding or vanishing. It is shown that the presented approach serves as a good initialization technique for deep networks and results in performances op par or slightly better than the existing approaches. The limited experimental validation and only small difference in accuracies compared to existing methods makes it difficult to judge the effectiveness of presented approach. Perhaps observing the statistics of output activations and gradients over training epochs in multiple experiments can better support the argument of stability of the network using proposed approach.

Authors might consider adding some validation for considering the backpropagation variance. On multiple occasions comparison is drawn against batch normalization which I believe does much more than a weight initialization technique. The presented approach is a good initialization technique just not sure if its better than existing ones.

The paper proposes a gating mechanism to combine word embeddings with character-level word representations.
The gating mechanism uses features associated to a word to decided which word representation is the most useful.
The fine-grain gating is applied as part of systems which seek to solve the task of cloze-style reading comprehension question answering, and Twitter hashtag prediction.
For the question answering task, a fine-grained reformulation of gated attention for combining document words and questions is proposed.
In both tasks the fine-grain gating helps to get better accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the CBT dataset and performing on-par with state-of-the-art approach on the SQuAD dataset.

OVERALL JUDGMENT

This paper proposes a clever fine-grained extension of a scalar gate for combining word representation.
It is clear and well written. It covers all the necessary prior work and compares the proposed method with previous similar models.

I liked the ablation study that shows quite clearly the impact of individual contributions.
And I also liked the fact that some (shallow) linguistic prior knowledge e.g., pos tags ner tags, frequency etc. has been used in a clever way. 
It would be interesting to see if syntactic features can be helpful.

196,False,Neural Graph Machines: Learning Neural Networks Using Graphs,"The paper proposes a model that aims at learning to label nodes of graph in a semi-supervised setting. The idea of the model is based on the use of the graph structure to regularize the representations learned at the node levels. Experimental results are provided on different tasks

The underlying idea of this paper (graph regularization) has been already explored in different papers – e.g 'Learning latent representations of nodes for classifying in heterogeneous social networks' [Jacob et al. 2014],   [Weston et al 2012] where a real graph structure is used instead of a built one. The experiments lack of strong comparisons with other graph models (e.g Iterative Classification, 'Learning from labeled and unlabeled data on a directed graph', ...). So the novelty of the paper and the experimental protocol are not strong enough to accpet the paper.

Pros:
* Learning over graph is an important topic

Cons:
* Many existing approaches have already exploited the same types of ideas, resulting in very close models
* Lack of comparison w.r.t existing models",,3.0,4.0
197,False,Neural Graph Machines: Learning Neural Networks Using Graphs,"The authors introduce a semi-supervised method for neural networks, inspired from label propagation.

The method appears to be exactly the same than the one proposed in (Weston et al, 2008) (the authors cite the 2012 paper). The optimized objective function in eq (4) is exactly the same than eq (9) in (Weston et al, 2008).

As possible novelty, the authors propose to use the adjacency matrix as input to the neural network, when there are no other features, and show success on the BlogCatalog dataset.

Experiments on text classification use neighbors according to word2vec average embedding to build the adjacency matrix. Top reported accuracies are not convincing compared to (Zhang et al, 2015) reported performance. Last experiment is on semantic intent classification, which a custom dataset; neighbors are also found according to a word2vec metric.

In summary, the paper propose few applications to the original (Weston et al, 2008) paper. It rebrands the algorithm under a new name, and does not bring any scientific novelty, and the experimental section lacks existing baselines to be convincing.",,3.0,4.0

1. they showed that graph augmented training for a range of different types of networks, including FF, CNN, RNNs etc. and works on a range of problems.
2. graphs help to train better networks, e.g. 3 layer CNN with graphs does as well as than 9 layer CNNs
3. graph augmented training works on a variety of different kinds of graphs.

However, all these points mentioned above seems to simply be different applications of the graph augmented training idea, and observations made during the applications.  I think it is therefore not proper to call the proposed model a novel model with a new name Neural Graph Machine, but rather making it clear in the paper that this is an empirical study of the model proposed by Weston et al. 2012 to different problems would be more acceptable.",,4.0,4.0

This paper proposes a regularizer that is claimed to help escaping from the saddle points. The method is inspired from physics, such that thinking of the optimization process is moving a positively charged particle would over the error surface which would be pushed away from saddle points due to the saddle point being positively changed as well. Authors of the paper show results over several different datasets.

Overview of the Review:
    Pros:
        - The idea is very interesting.
        - The diverse set of results on different datasets.
    Cons:
        - The justification is not strong enough.
        - The paper is not well-written.
        - Experiments are not convincing enough.

Criticisms:

I liked the idea and the intuitions coming from the paper. However, I think this paper is not written well. There are some variables introduced in the paper and not explained good-enough, for example in 2.3, the authors start to talk about p without introducing and defining it properly. The only other place it appears before is Equation 6. The Equations need some work as well, some work is needed in terms of improving the flow of the paper, e.g., introducing all the variables properly before using them.

Equation 6 appears without a proper explanation and justification. It is necessary to explain it what it means properly since I think this is one of the most important equation in this paper. More analysis on what it means in terms of optimization point of view would also be appreciated.

$\phi$ is not a parameter, it is a function which has its own hyper-parameter $\alpha$. 

It would be interesting to report validation or test results on a few tasks as well. Since this method introduced as an additional cost function, its effect on the validation/test results would be interesting as well.
The authors should discuss more on how they choose the hyper-parameters of their models. 

The Figure 2 and 3 does not add too much to the paper and they are very difficult to understand or draw any conclusions from. 

There are lots of Figures under 3.4.2 without any labels of captions. Some of them are really small and difficult to understand since the labels on the figures appear very small and somewhat unreadable.


A small question:

* Do you also backpropagate through $\tilde{\mW}_i^t$?",,5.0,4.0
201,False,Charged Point Normalization: An Efficient Solution to the Saddle Point Problem,"This paper proposes a novel method for accelerating optimization near saddle points. The basic idea is to repel the current parameter vector from a running average of recent parameter values. This method is shown to optimize faster than a variety of other methods in a variety of datasets and architectures.

On the surface, the proposed method seems extremely close to momentum. It would be very valuable to think of a clear diagram illustrating how it differs from momentum and why it might be better near a saddle point. The illustration of better convergence on the toy saddle example is not what I mean here—optimization speed comparisons are always difficult due to the many details and hyper parameters involved, so seeing it work faster in one specific application is not as useful as a conceptual diagram which shows a critical case where CPN will behave differently from—and clearly qualitatively better than—momentum.

Another way of getting at the relationship to momentum would be to try to find a form for R_t(f) that yields the exact momentum update. You could then compare this with the R_t(f) used in CPN.

The overly general notation $\phi(W,W)$ etc should be dropped—Eqn 8 is enough.

The theoretical results (Eqn 1 and Thm 1) should be removed, they are irrelevant until the joint density can be specified.

Experimentally, it would be valuable to standardize the results to allow comparison to other methods. For instance, recreating Figure 4 of Dauphin et al, but engaging the CPN method rather than SFN, would clearly demonstrate that CPN can escape something that momentum cannot.

I think the idea here is potentially very valuable, but needs more rigorous comparison and a clear relation to momentum and other work.",,4.0,4.0

  3. Lower bounds on the neural network size, as a function of its number of layers. The lower bound reveals the need of exponentially many more units to approximate functions using shallow architectures.

SPECIFIC COMMENTS 

- Thanks for the comments on L. Still it would be a good idea to clarify this point as far as possible in the main part. Also, I would suggest to advertise the main result more prominently. 
I still have not read the revision and maybe you have already addressed some of these points there. 

- The problem statement is close to that from [Montufar, Pascanu, Cho, Bengio NIPS 2014], which specifically arrives at exponential gaps between deep and shallow ReLU networks, albeit from a different angle. I would suggest to include that paper it in the overview. 

- In Lemma 3, there is an i that should be x

- In Theorem 4, ``\tilde f'' is missing the (x). 

- Theorem 11, the lower bound always increases with L ? 

- In Theorem 11, \bf x\in [0,1]^d?

205,False,Inverse Problems in Computer Vision using  Adversarial  Imagination Priors,"The paper describes a network architecture for inverse problems in computer vision. Example inverse problems considered are image inpainting, computing intrinsic image decomposition and foreground/background separation.
The architecture is composed of (i) a generator that produces target (latent) output (such as foreground / background regions), 
(ii) renderer that composes that latent output back to the image that can be compared with the input to measure reconstruction error, 
and (iii) adversarial prior that ensures the target output (latent) image respects a certain image statistics.

Strong  points.
- The proposed architecture with memory database is interesting and appears to be novel. 

Weak points:
- Experimental results are only proof-of-concept in toy set-ups and do not clearly demonstrate benefits of the proposed architecture.
- It is unclear whether the memory retrieval engine that retrieves images based on L2 distance on pixel values is going generalize to other more realistic scenarios. 
- Clarity. The clarity of explanation can be also improved (see below).


Detailed evaluation.

Originality:
- The novelty of this work lies in the (iii) adversarial prior that places an adversarial loss between the generated latent output and a single image retrieved from a large unlabelled database of target output examples (called memory). The adversarial prior has a convolutional form matching local image statistics, rather than the entire image.  The particular form of network architecture with the memory-based fully convolutional adversarial loss appears to be novel and potentially interesting.

- Motivation for the Architecture. The weakest point of the proposed architecture is the ""Memory retrieval engine"" R (section 2.4),
where images are retrieved from the memory by measuring L2 distance on pixel intensities. While this maybe ok for simple problems considered in this work, it is unclear how this can generalize to other more complicated datasets and problems.  
This should be better discussed, better justified and ideally results in some more realistic set-up shown (see below).


Quality:
- Experiments. Results are shown for inpainting of MNIST digits, intrinsic image decomposition on the MIT intrinsic image database, and figure/ground layer extraction on the synthesized dataset of 3D chairs rendered onto background from real photographs.  
 The experimental validation of the model is not very strong and proof-of-concept only. All the experiments are performed in simplified toy set-ups. The MNIST digit inpainting is far from current state-of-the-art on image inpainting in real photographs (see e.g. Pathak et al., 2016). The foreground background separation is done on  only synthetically generated test data. Even for intrinsic image demposition problem there is now relatively large-scale dataset of (Bell et al., 2014), see the citation below.  

While this is probably ok for the ICLR paper, it diminishes the significance of the work. Is this model going to be useful in a real settings? One possibility to address this would be to focus on one of the problems and show results on a challenging state-of-the-art data. It would be great to see the benefits of the memory database.

Clarity:
- The clarity of the writing can be improved. I found some of the terminology of the paper, specially the “imagination” and “memory” confusing. From figure 2, it is not clear how the “memories” for the given input image are obtained, which also took me some time to understand.

There are essentially no quantitative results, no real baselines, and only a small amount of not especially convincing qualititative results.

The framework is adapted to three tasks: (i) image in-painting, (ii) intrinsic image decomposition, (iii) figure-ground layer extraction.  Qualitative results are shown for all three tasks.

I think the proposed model has potential merits.  I particularly like the fact that it seems to be reasoning over image composites via matching against a bank of images (somewhat similar to “Segmenting Scenes by Matching Image Composites” work in NIPS 2009).  However, I won’t champion the paper as the overall clarity and evaluation could be improved.

More detailed comments:

I believe the fatal flaw of the paper is there is no quantitative evaluation of the approach.  At the very least, there should be a comparison against prior work on intrinsic image decomposition (e.g., SIRFS, maybe benchmark on ""intrinsic images in the wild” dataset).

I found the writing vague and confusing throughout.  For instance, “memory database” could mean a number of things, and in the end it seems that it’s simply a set of images.  “Imagination” is also vague.  On page 4, R(M,x) has the database and input image as arguments, but Fig 2 doesn’t show the input image as an input to R.  The contributions listed on page 3 should be tightened (e.g., it’s not clear what “Relevant memory retrieval for informative adversarial priors” means).  Fig 3 seems inconsistent with Fig 2 as the module for “memory database” is not present.  The fully-convolutional discriminator could use more details; one possibility is to provide a cost function.",,5.0,3.0
208,False,DeepRebirth: A General Approach for Accelerating Deep Neural Network Execution on Mobile Devices,"This paper proposes to reduce model size and evaluation time of deep CNN models on mobile devices by converting multiple layers into single layer and then retraining the converted model. The paper showed that the computation time can be reduced by 3x to 5x with only 0.4% accuracy loss on a specific model.

Reducing model sizes and speeding up model evaluation are important in many applications. I have several concerns:

1. There are many techniques that can reduce model sizes. For example, it has been shown by several groups that using the teacher-student approach, people can achieve the same and sometimes even better accuracy than the teacher (big model) using a much smaller model. However, this paper does not compare any one of them.
2. The technique proposed in this paper is limited in its applicability since it's designed specifically for the models discussed in the paper. 
3. Replacing several layers with single layer is a relatively standard procedure. For example, the mean variance normalization layer and batch normalization layer can all be absorbed without retraining or losing accuracy.

209,False,DeepRebirth: A General Approach for Accelerating Deep Neural Network Execution on Mobile Devices,One of the main idea of this paper is to replace pooling layers with convolutions of stride 2 and retraining the model. Authors merge this into a new layer and brand it as a new type of layer. This is very misleading and adding noise to the field. And using strided convolutions rather than pooling is not actually novel (e.g. ,,4.0,4.0
210,False,DeepRebirth: A General Approach for Accelerating Deep Neural Network Execution on Mobile Devices,"This paper looks at the idea of fusing multiple layers (typically a convolution and a LRN or pooling layer) into a single convolution via retraining of just that layer, and shows that simpler, faster models can be constructed that way at minimal loss in accuracy. This idea is fine. Several issues:
- The paper introduces the concept of a 'Deeprebirth layer', and for a while it seems like it's going to be some new architecture. Mid-way, we discover that 1) it's just a convolution 2) it's actually a different kind of convolution depending on whether one fuses serial or parallel pooling layers. I understand the desire to give a name to the technique, but in this case naming the layer itself, when it's actually multiple things, non of which are new architecturally, confuses the argument a lot.
- There are ways to perform this kind of operator fusion without retraining, and some deep learning framework such as Theano and the upcoming TensorFlow XLA implement them. It would have been nice to have a baseline that implements it, especially since most of the additional energy cost from non-fused operators comes from the extra intermediate memory writes that operator fusion removes.
- Batchnorm can be folded into convolution layers without retraining by scaling the weights. Were they folded into the baseline figures reported in Table 7?
- At the time of writing, the authors have not provided the details that would make this research reproducible, in particular how the depth of the fused layers relates to the depth of the original layers in each of the experiments.
- Retraining: how much time (epochs) does the retraining take? Did you consider using any form of distillation?
Interesting set of experiments. This paper needs a lot of improvements to be suitable for publication.
- Open-sourcing: having the implementation be open-source always enhances the usefulness of such paper. Not a requirement obviously.

215,False,Two Methods for Wild Variational Inference,"The authors propose methods for wild variational inference, in which the
variational approximating distribution may not have a directly accessible
density function. Their approach is based on the Stain's operator, which acts
on a given function and returns a zero mean function with respect to a given
density function which may not be normalized.

Quality:

The derviations seem to be technically sound. However, my impression is that
the authors are not very careful and honest at evaluating both the strengths
and weaknesses of the proposed work. How does the method perform in cases in
which the distribution to be approximated is high dimensional? The logistic
regression problem considered only has 54 dimensions. How would this method
perform in a neural network in which the number of weights is goint to be way
much larger? The logistic regression model is rather simple and its posterior
will be likely to be close to Gaussian. How would the method perform in more
complicated posteriors such as the ones of Bayesia neural networks?

Clarity:

The paper is not clearly written. I found it very really hard to follow and not
focused. The authors describe way too many methods: 1) Stein's variational
gradient descent (SVGD), 2) Amortized SVGD, 3) Kernelized Stein discrepancy

Stein's discrepancy. I found very difficult to indentify the clear

It is very hard to evaluate the importance of proposed methods. The authors
only report results on a 1d toy problem with a mixture of Gaussians and on a
logistic regression model with dimension 54. In both cases the distributions to
be approximated are very simple and of low dimension. In the regression case

how the particle based methods can deal with the multimodality (not the simple
1d gaussian mixture case) in general. Also, the method seems still to require to evaluate
the true gradient of the target distribution (e.g., the posterior distribution) for 
each z ~ q. This seems to be a computational problem for large dataset settings. 
In the experiments, the authors compare the methods for the same number of 
update steps. But, considering the light computation of SGLD per update, I think 
SGLD can make much more updates per unit time than the proposed methods, 
particularly for large datasets. The Bayesian logistic regression on 54 dimensions
seems also a quite simple experiment, considering that its posterior is close to 
a Gaussian distribution. Also, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) with 
automatic hyperparameter tuning mechanism (like, no u-turn sampler) would be
interesting.

The paper is written very unclearly. Especially, it is not clear what is the exact
contributions of the paper compared to the other previous works including the
authors' works. The main message is quite simple but most of the pages are 
spent to explain previous works. 

Overall, I'd like to suggest to have more significant high-dimension, large scale 
experiments, and to improve the writing.

217,False,Two Methods for Wild Variational Inference,"The authors propose two variational methods based on the theme of posterior approximations which may not have a tractable density. The first is from another ICLR submission on ""amortized SVGD"" (Wang and Liu, 2016), where here the innovation is in using SGLD as the inference network. The second is from a NIPS paper (Ranganath et al., 2016) on minimizing the Stein divergence with a parametric approximating family, where here the innovation is in defining their test functions to be an RKHS, obtaining an analytic solution to the inner optimization problem.

The methodology is incremental. Everything up to Section 3.2 is essentially motivation, background, or related work. The notion of a ""wild variational approximation"" was already defined in Ranganath et al. (2016), termed a ""variational program"". It would be useful for the authors to comment on the difference, if any.

Section 3.2 is at first interesting because it analytically solves the maximum problem that is faced in Ranganath et al. (2016). However, this requires use of a kernel which will certainly not scale in high dimensions, so it is then equivalent in practice to having chosen a very simple test function family. To properly scale to high dimensions would require a deeper kernel and also learning its parameters; this is not any easier than parameterizing the test function family as a neural network to begin with, which Ranganath et al. (2016) do.

Section 4 introduces a Langevin inference network, which essentially chooses the variational approximation as an evolving sequence of Markov transition operators as in Salimans et al. (2015). I had trouble understanding this for a while because I could not understand what they mean by inference network. None of it is amortized in the usual inference network sense, which is that the parameters are given by the output of a neural network. Here, the authors simple define global parameters of the SGLD chain which are used across all the latent variables (which is strictly worse?). (What then makes it an ""inference network""?) Is this not the variational approximation used in Salimans et al. (2015), but using a different objective to train it?

The experiments are limited, on a toy mixture of Gaussians posterior and Bayesian logistic regression. None of this addresses the problems one might suspect on high-dimensional and real data, such as the lack of scalability for the kernel, the comparison to Salimans et al. (2015) for the Langevin variational approximation, and any note of runtime or difficulty of training.

Minor comments

+ It's not clear if the authors understood previous work on expressive variational families or inference networks. For example, they argue Rezende & Mohamed, 2015b; Tran et al., 2015; Ranganath et al., 2015 require handcrafted inference networks. However, all of them assume use of any neural network for amortized inference. None of them even require an inference network. Perhaps the authors mean handcrafted posterior approximations, which to some extent is true; however, the three mentioned are all algorithmic in nature: in Rezende & Mohamed (2015), the main decision choice is the flow length; Tran et al. (2015), the size of the variational data; Ranganath et al. (2015), the flow length on the auxiliary variable space. Each works well on different problems, but this is also true of variational objectives which admit intractable q (as the latter two consider, as does Salimans et al. (2015)). The paper's motivation could be better explained, and perhaps the authors could be clearer on what they mean by inference network.
+ I also recommend the authors not term a variational inference method based on the class of approximating family. While black box variational inference in Ranganath et al. (2014) assumes a mean-field family, the term itself has been used in the literature to mean any variational method that imposes few constraints on the model class.",,3.0,4.0

223,False,Sample Importance in Training Deep Neural Networks,"(paper summary) The authors introduce the notion of “sample importance”, meant to measure the influence of a particular training example on the training of a deep neural network. This quantity is closely related to the squared L2 norm of the gradient, where the summation is performed over (i) parameters of a given layer or (ii) across all parameters. Summing this quantity across time gives the “overall importance”, used to tease apart easy from hard examples. From this quantity, the authors illustrate the impact of [easy,hard] example during training, and their impact on layer depth.

(detailed review)
I have several objections to this paper. First and foremost, I am not convinced of the “sample importance” as a meaningful metric. As previously mentioned, the magnitude of gradients will change significantly during learning, and I am not sure what conclusions one can draw from \sum_t g_i^t vs \sum_t g_j^t. For example, gradients tend to have higher norms early in training than at convergence, in which case weighting each gradient equally seems problematic. I tried illustrating the above with a small thought experiment during the question period: “if” the learning rate were too high, training may not even converge in which case sample importance would be ill-defined.  Having a measure which depends on the learning rate seems problematic to me, as does the use of the L2 norm. The “input Fisher” norm, \mathbb{E} \frac{\partial \log p} {\partial x} (for a given time-step) may be better suited, as it speaks directly to the sensitivity of the classifier to the input x (and is insensitive to changes in the mean gradient norm). But again summing Fisher norms across time may not be meaningful.

The experimental analysis also seems problematic. The authors claim from Fig. 2 that output layers are primarily learnt in the early stage of training. However, this is definitely not the case for CIFAR-10 and is debatable for MNIST: sample importance remains high for all layers during training, despite a small spike early on the output layer. Fig 2. (lower, middle) and Fig. 6 also seems to highlight an issue with the SI measure: the SI is dominated by the input layer which has the most parameters, and can thus more readily impact the gradient norm. Different model architectures may have yielded different conclusions. Had the authors managed to use the SI to craft a better curriculum, this would have given significant weight to the measure. Unfortunately, these results are negative.

PROS:
+ extensive experiments

CONS:
- sample importance is a heuristic, not entirely well justified
- SI yields limited insight into training of neural nets
- SI does not inform curriculum learning",,3.0,4.0
224,False,Sample Importance in Training Deep Neural Networks,"The paper proposes a new criterion (sample importance) to study the impact of samples during the training of deep neural networks. This criterion is not clearly defined (the term \phi^t_{i,j} is never defined, only \phi^t_i is defined; Despite the unclear definition, it is understood that sample importance is the squared l2 norm of the gradient for a sample i and at time t strangely scaled by the squared learning rate (the learning rate should have nothing to do with the importance of a sample in this context).

The paper presents experiments on the well known MNIST and CIFAR datasets with correspondingly appropriate network architectures and choice of hyper-parameters and initialisations. The size of the hidden layers is a bit small for Mnist and very small for CIFAR (this could explain the very poor performance in figure 6: 50% error on CIFAR)

The study of the evolution of sample importance during training depending on layers seems to lead to trivial conclusions
 - “the overall sample importance is different under different epochs” => yes the norm of the gradient is expected to vary
 - “Output layer always has the largest average sample importance per parameter, and its contribution reaches the maximum in the early training stage and then drops” => 1. yes since the gradient flows backwards, the gradient is expected to be stronger for the output layer and it is expected to become more diffuse as it propagates to lower layers which are not stable. As learning progresses one would expect the output layer to have progressively smaller gradients. 2. the norm of the gradient depends on the scaling of the variables

The question of Figure 4 is absurd “Is Sample Importance the same as Negative log-likelihood of a sample?”. Of course not.

The results are very bad on CIFAR which discredits the applicability of those results.

On Mnist performance is not readable (figure 7): Error rate should only be presented between 0 and 10 or 20%

Despite these important issues (there are others), the paper manages to raises some interesting things: the so-called easy samples and hard samples do seem to correspond (although the study is very preliminary in this regard) to what would intuitively be considered easy (the most representative/canonical samples) and hard (edge cases) samples.

The paper shows some interesting results contrary to the common curriculum learning ideas of using easy training samples first. However, it is unclear how one should define ""Easy"" training cases.

In addition, the experiments demonstrating ordering either NLL or SI is worse than mixed or random batch construction to be insightful.

Possible Improvements:
It would be nice to factor out the magnitudes of the gradients to the contribution of ""sample importance"". Higher gradient (as a function of a particular weight vector) can be affected weight/initialization, thereby introducing noise to the model.

The authors propose a recurrent neural network approach for constructing a

approximation to the posterior distribution for the latent variables given the
past data. This variational approximation is used to maximize the marginal
likelihood in order to learn the parameters of the model. The proposed method

to outperform parametric GARCH models and a Gaussian process volatility model.

The DANN is used to make the representations domain invariant, therefore achieving cross domain adaptation.

Experiments are done on a number of data sets, and the proposed method (VRADA) outperforms baselines including DANN, VFAE and R-DANN on almost all of them.

I don't have questions about the proposed model, the model is quite clear and seems to be a simple combination of VRNN and DANN.  But a few questions came up during the pre-review question phase:

- As the authors have mentioned, DANN in general outperforms MMD based methods, however, the VFAE method which is based on MMD regularization on the representations seems to outperform DANN across the board.  That seems to indicate VRNN + MMD should also be a good combination.

- One baseline the authors showed in the experiments is R-DANN, which is an RNN version of DANN.  There are two differences between R-DANN and VRADA: (1) R-DANN uses deterministic RNN for representation learning, while VRADA uses variational RNN; (2) on target domain R-DANN only optimizes adversarial loss, while VRADA optimizes both adversarial loss and reconstruction loss for feature learning.  It would be good to analyze further where the performance gain comes from.",,6.0,4.0

The new contribution of the work is relatively small. It extends VRNN with adversarial training for learning domain agnostic representations. From the experimental results, the proposed method clearly out-performs competing algorithms. However, it is not clear where the advantage is coming from. The only difference between the proposed method and R-DANN is using variational RNN vs RNN. Little insights were provided on how this could bring such a big difference in terms of performance and the drastic difference in the temporal dependencies captured by these two methods in Figure 4.

This paper proposes a domain adaptation technique for time series. The core of the approach is a combination of variational recurrent neural networks and adversarial domain adaptation (at the last time step).

Pros:

1. The authors consider a very important application of domain adaptation.

2. The paper is well-written and relatively easy to read.

3. Solid empirical evaluation. The authors compare their method against several recent domain adaptation techniques on a number of datasets.

2. Figure 1(c) looks very suspicious. I can hardly believe t-SNE could produce this _very_ regular structure for non-degenerate (non-synthetic, real-world) data.

232,False,Tuning Recurrent Neural Networks with Reinforcement Learning,"The authors propose a solution for the task of synthesizing melodies. The authors claim that the ""language-model""-type approaches with LSTMs generate melodies with certain shortcomings. They tend to lack long-range structure, to repeat notes etc. To solve this problem the authors suggest that the model could be first trained as a pure LM-style LSTM and then trained with reinforcement learning to optimize an objective which includes some non-differentiable music-theory related constraints. 

The reinforcement learning methodology is appropriate but straightforward and closely resembles previous work for text modeling and dialogue generation. By itself the methodology doesn't offer a new technique. 

To me, the paper's contribution then comes down to the novelty / utility / impact of the application. The authors clearly put substantial of effort into crafting the rules and user study and that is commendable. On the other hand, music itself is dealt with somewhat naively. While the user study reflects hard work, it seems premature. The semi-plausible piano melodies here are only music in the way that LSTM Shakespeare passes as poetry. So it's analogous to conducting a user study comparing LSTM Shakespeare to n-gram Shakespeare. 

I'd caution the author's against the uncritical motivation that a problem has previously been studied. Research contains abundant dead ends (not to say this is necessarily one) and the burden to motivate research shouldn't be forgotten. This is especially true when the application is the primary thrust of a paper.

Generally the authors should be careful about describing this model as ""composing"". By analogy to a Shakespeare-LSTM, the language model is not really composing English prose. The relationship between constructing a statistical sequence model and creating art - an activity that involves communication grounded in real-world semantics should not be overstated. 

I appreciate the authors' efforts to respond to some criticisms of the problem setup and encourage them to anticipate these arguments in the paper and to better motivate the work in the future. If the main contribution is the application (the methods have been used elsewhere), then the motivation is of central importance. I also appreciate their contention that the field benefits from multiple datasets and not simply relying on language modeling. Further, they are correct in asserting that MIDI can capture all the information in a score (not merely ""Gameboy music"", and that for some musics (e.g. European classical) the score is of central importance. However, the authors may overstate the role of a score in jazz music.

Overall, for me, the application, while fun, doesn't add enough to the impact of the paper. And the methodology, while appropriate, doesn't stand on its own.

234,False,Tuning Recurrent Neural Networks with Reinforcement Learning,"This paper suggests combining LSTMs, trained on a large midi corpus, with a handcrafted reward function that helps to fine-tune the model in a musically meaningful way. The idea to use hand-crafted rewards in such a way is great and seems promising for practical scenarios, where a musician would like to design a set of rules, rather than a set of melodies.

Even though some choices made along the way seem rather ad-hoc and simplistic from a music theoretical perspective, the results sound like an improvement upon the note RNN baseline, but we also don't know how cherry picked these results are. 
I am not convinced that this approach will scale to much more complicated reward functions necessary to compose real music. Maybe LSTMs are the wrong approach altogether if they have so much trouble learning to produce pleasant melodies from such a relatively big corpus of data. Aren't there any alternative differentiable models that are more suitable? What about dilated convolution based approaches?

What I don't like about the paper is that the short melodies are referenced as compositions while being very far from meaningful music, they are not even polyphonic after all. I think it would be great if such papers would be written with the help or feedback of people that have real musical training and are more critical towards these details. 

What I like about the paper is that the authors make an effort to understand what is going on, table 1 is interesting for instance. However, Figure 3 should have included real melody excerpts with the same sound synthesis/sample setup. Besides that, more discussion on the shortcomings of the presented method should be added.

235,False,Tuning Recurrent Neural Networks with Reinforcement Learning,"This paper uses a combination of likelihood and reward based learning to learn sequence models for music. The ability to combine likelihood and reward based learning has been long known, as a result of the unification of inference and learning first appearing in the ML literature with the EM formalism of Attias (2003) for fixed horizons, extended by Toussaint and Storkey (2006), to general horizon settings, Toussaint et al. (2011) to POMDPs and generalised further by Kappen et Al. (2012) and Rawlik et Al. (2012). These papers introduced the basic unification, and so any additional probabilistic or data driven objective can be combined with the reinforcement learning signal: it is all part of a unified reward/likelihood. Hence the optimal control target under unification is p(b=1|\tau)E_p(A,S) \prod_t \pi(a_t|s_t): i.e. the probability of getting reward, and probability of the policy actions under the known data-derived distribution, thereby introducing the log p(a_t|s_t) into (9) too.

The interpretation of the secondary objective as the prior is an alternative approach under a stochastic optimal control setting, but not the most natural one given the whole principle of SOC of matching control objectives to inference objectives. The SOC off policy objective still does still contain the KL term so the approach would still differ from the approach of this paper.

Though the discussion of optimal control is good, I think some further elaboration of the history and how reward augmentation can work in SOC would be valuable. This would allow SOC off-policy methods to be compared with the DQN directly, like for like.

The motivation of the objective (3) is sensible but could be made clearer via the unification argument above. Then the paper uses DCN to take a different approach from the variational SOC for achieving that objective.

Another interesting point of discussion is the choice of E_pi \log p(a_t|s_t) – this means the policy must “cover” the model. But one problem in generation is that a well-trained model is often underfit, resulting in actions that, over the course of a number of iterations, move the state into data-unsupported parts of the space. As a result the model is no longer confident and quickly tends to be fairly random. This approach (as opposed to a KL(p||pi) – which is not obvious how to implement) cannot mitigate against that, without a very strong signal (to overcome the tails of a distribution). In music, with a smaller discrete alphabet, this is likely to be less of a problem than for real valued policy densities, with exponentially decaying tails. Some further discussion of what you see in light of this issue would be valuable: the use of c to balance things seems critical, and it seems clear from Figure 2 that the reward signal needed to be very high to push the log p signal into the right range.

Altogether, in the music setting this paper provides a reasonable demonstration that augmentation of a sequence model with an additional reward constraint is valuable. It demonstrates that DQN is one way of learning that signal, but AFAICS it does not compare learning the same signal via other techniques. Instead for the comparator techniques it reverts to treating the p(a|s) as a “prior” term rather than a reward term, leaving a bit of a question as to whether DQN is particularly appropriate. 

Another interesting question for the discussion is whether the music theory reward could be approximated by a differentiable model, mitigating the need for an RL approach at all.",,5.0,5.0
236,False,Tuning Recurrent Neural Networks with Reinforcement Learning,"Very nice work!
Interesting to see how well it works to combine a reward signal with cross-entropy from an informative prior, even without the extra entropy regularization of the KL cost.

We would like to note a few important things, though:

1. Psi-learning is not the method given in (11), (12), and Appendix 8.1.1.
Using the current policy as the prior for each small policy update is central to Psi-learning and for the properties of the Psi function.
This is best seen by comparing your (23) with Rawlik et al.'s (14), where they have Psi-\bar{Psi} substituted for log(p).
By having p fixed and not dependent of Psi, you are qualitatively changing the fixed point of the equation.
For example, their Psi function is gap increasing, in that it only recovers the value function in the optimal action, and is negative infinity for suboptimal actions — your ""Psi"" function does not have this property, and the two should not be confused.

2. Psi-learning is distinct from G-learning, in that the former uses small divergences from a changing prior, while the latter uses large divergences from a fixed prior.
By fixing the prior p in both of your derivations, both are using G-learning with a fixed temperature, albeit with different parameterization of the function G.
The two functions defined in (16) and (24) differ by the constant log(p), and this is then reflected in (23) and (30).
Intriguingly, parameterizing G+log(p) yields better results than parameterizing G.
This is somewhat reminiscent of advantage learning, where one parameterizes Q-V rather than Q, and certainly merits further study.

3. In DQN, the Q-network is a feed-forward network that maps (s,a) inputs into real outputs.
If this is the architecture used here, it is unclear how it is initialized from the differently shaped Note RNN.
On other hand, if the Q-network here is a RNN, it is unclear what state it keeps and how it computes Q(s,a;theta).

4. As Figure 2 shows, ""G-learning"" achieves a different tradeoff with worse music-theory reward but better log(p).
It is therefore inaccurate to characterize it in Section 6 and Table 1 as doing worse.
For a fair comparison, one needs to set c differently for each algorithm, so that one reward is the same, and compare the other reward.
It would also be useful to repeat this for various values of c, and plot the two rewards on a plane, to allow comparing the reward-achievability regions of the algorithms.

237,True,Recurrent Mixture Density Network for Spatiotemporal Visual Attention,"This paper proposes a new method for estimating visual attention in videos. The input clip is first processed by a convnet (in particular, C3D) to extract visual features. The visual features are then passed to LSTM. The hidden state at each time step in LSTM is used to generate the parameters in a Gaussian mixture model. Finally, the visual attention map is generated from the Gaussian mixture model.

Overall, the idea in this paper is reasonable and the paper is well written. RNN/LSTM has been used in lots of vision problem where the outputs are discrete sequences, there has not been much work on using RNN/LSTM for problems where the output is continuous like in this paper.

The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In particular, it outperforms other state-of-the-art on the saliency prediction task on the Hollywood2 datasets. It also shows improvement over baselines (e.g. C3D + SVM) on the action recognition task.

My only ""gripe"" of this paper is that this paper is missing some important baseline comparisons. In particular, it does not seem to show how the ""recurrent"" part help the overall performance. Although Table 2 shows RMDN outperforms other state-of-the-art, it might be due to the fact that it uses strong C3D features (while other methods in Table 2 use traditional handcrafted features). Since saliency prediction is essentially a dense image labeling problem (similar to semantic segmentation). For dense image labeling, there has been lots of methods proposed in the past two years, e.g. fully convolution neural network (FCN) or deconvnet. A straightforward baseline is to simply take FCN and apply it on each frame. If the proposed method still outperforms this baseline, we can know that the ""recurrent"" part really helps.",,6.0,4.0
238,True,Recurrent Mixture Density Network for Spatiotemporal Visual Attention,"The authors formulate a recurrent deep neural network to predict human fixation locations in videos as a mixture of Gaussians. They train the model using maximum likelihood with actual fixation data. Apart from evaluating how good the model performs at predicting fixations, they combine the saliency predictions with the C3D features for action recognition.

quality: I am missing a more thorough evaluation of the fixation prediction performance. The center bias performance in Table 1 differs significantly from the on in Table 2. All the state-of-the-art models reported in Table 2 have a performance worse than the center bias performance reported in Table 1. Is there really no other model better than the center bias? Additionally I am missing details on how central bias and human performance are modelled. Is human performance cross-validated?

You claim that your ""results are very close to human performance (the difference is only 3.2%). This difference is actually larger than the difference between Central Bias and your model reported in Table 1. Apart from this, it is dangerous to compare AUC performance differences due to e.g. saturation issues.

clarity: the explanation for Table 3 is a bit confusing, also it is not clear why the CONV5 and the FC6 models differ in how the saliency map is used. At least one should also evaluate the CONV5 model when multiplying the input with the saliency map to see how much of the difference comes from the different ways to use the saliency map and how much from the different features.

Other issues:

You cite Kümmerer et. al 2015 as a model which ""learns ... indirectly rather than from explicit information of where humans look"", however the their model has been trained on fixation data using maximum-likelihood.

Apart from these issues, I think the paper make a very interesting contribution to spatio-temporal fixation prediction. If the evaluation issues given above are sorted out, I will happily improve my rating.",,7.0,4.0
239,True,Recurrent Mixture Density Network for Spatiotemporal Visual Attention,"This work proposes to a spatiotemporal saliency network that is able to mimic human fixation patterns,

The work is interesting and has shown state-of-the-art results on predicting human attention on action videos.
It has also shown promise for helping action clip classification.

The paper would benefit from a discussion on the role of context in attention.
For instance, if context is important, and people give attention to context, why is it not incorporated automatically in your model?

One weak point is the action recognition section, where the comparison between the two (1)(2) and (3) seems unfair.
The attention weighted feature maps in fact reduce the classification performance, and only improve performance when doubling the feature and associated model complexity by concatenating the weighted maps with the original features.

Is there a way to combine the context and attention without concatenation?
The rational for concatenating the features extracted from the original clip,
and the features extracted from the saliency weighted clip seems to contradict the initial hypothesis that `eliminating or down-weighting pixels that are not important' will improve performance.

The authors should also mention the current state-of-the-art results in Table 4, for comparison.

Pros: 
- group-sparse auto-encoder seems new to me.
- extensive experiments on QA tasks. 

Cons:
- The idea is somewhat incremental.
- Writing need to be improved. 
- Lack of ablation studies to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 

Moreover, I am not convinced by the author's answer regarding the baseline. A separate training stages of CNN+SGL for comparison is fine. The purpose is to validate and analyze why the proposed SGA is preferred rather than group lasso, e.g. joint training could improve, or the proposed group-sparse regularization outperforms l_21 norm, etc. However, we can't see it from the current experiments.",,5.0,4.0
241,False,Group Sparse CNNs for Question Sentence Classification with Answer Sets,"The paper proposes the group sparse autoencoder that enforces sparsity of the hidden representation group-wise, where the group is formed based on labels (i.e., supervision). The p-th group hidden representation is used for reconstruction with group sparsity penalty, allowing learning more discriminative, class-specific patterns in the dataset. The paper also propose to combine both group-level and individual level sparsity as in Equation (9). 

Clarity of the paper is a bit low. 
- Do you use only p-th group's activation for reconstruction? If it is true, then for Equation (9) do you use all individual hidden representation for reconstruction or still using the subset of representation corresponding to that class only? 
- In Equation (7), RHS misses the summation over p, and wondering it is a simple typo.
- Is the algorithm end-to-end trainable? It seems to me that the group sparse CNN is no more than the GSA whose input data is the feature extracted from sequential CNNs (or any other pretrained CNNs).

Other comments are as follows:
- Furthermore the group sparse autoencoder is (semi-) supervised method since it uses label information to form a group, whereas the standard sparse autoencoder is fully unsupervised. That being said, it is not surprising that group sparse autoencoder learns more class-specific pattern whereas sparse autoencoder doesn't. I think the fair comparison should be to autoencoders that combines classification for their objective function.
- Although authors claim that GSA learns more group-relevant features, Figure 3 (b) is not convincing enough to support this claim. For example, the first row contains many filters that doesn't look like 1 (e.g., very last column looks like 3).
- Other than visual inspection, do you observe improvement in classification using proposed algorithm on MNIST experiments?
- The comparison to the baseline model is missing. I believe the baseline model shouldn't be the sequential CNN, but the sequential CNN + sparse autoencoder. In addition, more control experiment is required that compares between the Equation (7)-(9), with different values of \alpha and \beta.

The paper does a good of explaining why phenomenon occurs, by analyzing the ""sharpness"" of the loss function for large-batch and small-batch trained models.  

Some other connections that I think would be interesting to explore: 
  -If you use very small minibatches, does generalization get even better (perhaps at the expense of very slow training).  
  -Can other forms of noise injection compensate for the use of a larger minibatch?  For example, if I inject increasing amounts of noise into the gradients or the parameters with larger batches, does this close the gap with small-batch training?

- Is the resulting model still a universal approximator? (providing large enough hidden dimensions and number of layers)
- More generally, can one compare the expressiveness of the model with the equivalent model without the orthogonal matrices? with the same number of parameters for instance?

246,False,Rotation Plane Doubly Orthogonal Recurrent Neural Networks,"My main objection with this work is that it operates under a hypothesis (that is becoming more and more popular in the literature) that all we need is to have gradients flow in order to solve long term dependency problems. The usual approach is then to enforce orthogonal matrices which (in absence of the nonlinearity) results in unitary jacobians, hence the gradients do not vanish and do not explode. However this hypothesis is taken for granted (and we don't know it is true yet) and instead of synthetic data, we do not have any empirical evidence that is strong enough to convince us the hypothesis is true. 

My own issues with this way of thinking is: a) what about representational power; restricting to orthogonal matrices it means we can not represent the same family of functions as before (e.g. we can't have complex attractors and so forth if we run the model forward without any inputs). You can only get those if you have eigenvalues larger than 1. It also becomes really hard to deal with noise (since you attempt to preserve every detail of the input, or rather every part of the input affects the output). Ideally you would want to preserve only what you need for the task given limited capacity. But you can't learn to do that. My issue is that everyone is focused on solving this preserved issue without worrying of the side-effects.

One gripe is that that the novelty lies in the choice of application domain as opposed to the methods. Lack of word-level comparisons also makes it difficult to determine the importance of using sentence-level information vs. choices in model architecture/decoding, and finally, the GRID dataset itself appears limited with the grammar and use of a n-gram dictionary.

253,True,Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks for Resource Efficient Inference,Authors propose a neural pruning technique starting from trained models using an approximation of change in the cost function and outperform other criteria. Authors obtain solid speedups while maintaining reasonable accuracy thanks to finetuning after pruning. Comparisons to existing methods is weak as GFLOPS graphs only show a couple simple baselines and no prior work baselines.

255,True,Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks for Resource Efficient Inference,"Authors propose a strategy for pruning weights with the eventual goal of reducing GFLOP computations. The pruning strategy is well motivated using the taylor expansion of the neural network function with respect to the feature activations. The obtained strategy removes feature maps that have both a small activation and a small gradient (eqn 7). 

(A) Ideally the gradient of the output with respect to the activation functions should be 0 at the optimal, but as a result of stochastic gradient evaluations this would practically never be zero. Small variance in the gradient across mini-batches indicates that irrespective of input data the specific network parameter is unlikely to change - intuitively these are parameters that are closer to convergence. Parameters/weights that are close to convergence and also result in a small activation are intuitively good candidates for pruning. This is essentially what eqn 7 conveys and is likely to be reason why just removing weights that result in small activations is not as good of a pruning strategy (as shown by results in the paper). There are two kind of differences in weights that are removed by activation v/s taylor expansion:
1. Weights with high-activations but very low gradients will be removed by taylor expansion, but not by activation alone. 
2. Weights with low-activation but high gradients will be removed by activation criterion, but not by taylor expansion. 
It will be interesting to analyze which of (1) or (2) contribute more to the differences in weights that are removed by the taylor expansion v/s activation criterion. Intuitively it seems that weight that satisfy (1) are important because they are converged and contribute significantly to network's activation. It is possible that a modified criterion - eqn (7) + \lambda feature activation, (where \lambda needs to be found by cross-validation) may lead to even better results at the cost of more parameter tuning. 
  
(B) Another interesting comparison is with the with the optimal damage framework - where the first order gradients are assumed to be zero and pruning is performed using the second-order information (also discussed by authors in the appendix). Critically, only the diagonal of the Hessian is computed. There is no comparison with optimal damage as authors claim it is memory and computation inefficient. Back of envelope calculations suggest that this would result only in 50% increase in memory and computation during pruning, but no loss in efficiency during testing. Therefore from a standpoint of deployment, I don't think this missing comparison is justified. 

(C) The eventual goal of the authors is to reduce GFLOPs. Some recent papers have proposed using lower precision computation for this. A comparison in GFLOPs with lower precision v/s pruning would be a great. While both these approaches are complementary and it is expected that combining both of them can lead to superior performance than either of the two - it is unclear when we are operating in the low-precision regime how much pruning can be performed. Any analysis on this tradeoff would be great (but not necessary).

(D) On finetuning, authors report results of AlexNet and VGG on two different datasets - Flowers and Birds respectively. Why is this the case? It would be great to see the results of both the networks on both the datasets. 

(E) Authors report there is only a small drop in performance after pruning. Suppose the network was originally trained with N iterations, and then M finetuning iterations were performed during pruning. This means that pruned networks were trained for N + M iterations. The correct comparison in accuracies would be if we the original network was also trained for N + M iterations. In figure 4, does the performance at 100% parameters reports accuracy after N+M iterations or after N iterations? 

Overall I think the paper is technically and empirically sound, it proposes a new strategy for pruning:
(1) Based on taylor expansion
(2) Feature normalization to reduce parameter tuning efforts. 
(3) Iterative finetuning. 
However, I would like to see some comparisons mentioned in my comments above. If those comparisons are made I would change my ratings to an accept.

256,True,Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks for Resource Efficient Inference,"This paper presents a novel way of pruning filters from convolutional neural networks with a strong theoretical justification. The proposed methods is derived from the first order Taylor expansion of the loss change while pruning a particular unit. This leads to simple weighting of the unit activation with its gradient w.r.t. loss function and performs better than simply using the activation magnitude as the heuristic for pruning. This intuitively makes sense, as we would like to remove not only the filters with low activation, but also filters where the incorrect activation value would not have small influence on the target loss.

Authors thoroughly investigate multiple baselines, including an oracle which sets an upper bound on the target performance even though it is computationally expensive. The devised method seems to be quite elegant and authors show that it generalizes well on multiple tasks and is computationally more than feasible as it is easy to combine with traditional fine tuning procedure. Also, the work clearly shows the trade-offs of increased speed and decreased performance, which is useful for practical applications.

It would be also useful to compare against different baselines, e.g. [1]. However this method seems to be more useful as it does not involve training of a new network (and thus is probably much faster).

Suggestion - maybe it can be extended in the future towards also removing only parts of the filters(e.g. for the 3D convolution)? This may be more complicated as it would need to change the implementation of convolution operator, but can lead to further speedup.

258,True,Learning and Policy Search in Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Bayesian Neural Networks,"This paper considers the problem of model-based policy search. The authors 
consider the use of Bayesian Neural Networks to learn a model of the environment
and advocate for the $\alpha$-divergence minimization rather than the more usual 
variational Bayes. 

The ability of alpha-divergence to capture bi-modality however 
comes at a price and most of the paper is devoted to finding tractable approximations. 
The authors therefore use the approach of Hernandez-Lobato
et al. (2016) as proxy to the alpha-divergence . 

The environment/system dynamics is clearly defined as a well as the policy parametrization 
(section 3) and would constitute a useful reference point for other researchers. 
Simulated roll-outs, using the learned model, then provide samples of the expected 
return. Since a model of the environment is available, stochastic gradient descent 
can be performed in the usual way, without policy gradient estimators, via automatic 
differentiation tools. 

The experiments demonstrate that alpha-divergence is capable of capturing multi-model 
structure which competing methods (variational Bayes and GP) would otherwise
struggle with. The proposed approach also compares favorably in a real-world
batch setting.

The paper is well-written, technically rich and combines many recent tools 
into a coherent algorithm. However, the repeated use of approximations to original 
quantities seems to somehow defeat the benefits of the original problem formulation. 
The scalability and computational effectiveness of this approach is also questionable 
and I am uncertain if many problem would warrant such complexity in their solution.

259,True,Learning and Policy Search in Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Bayesian Neural Networks,"This paper introduces an approach for model-based control of stochastic dynamical systems with policy search, based on (1) learning the stochastic dynamics of the underlying system with a Bayesian deep neural network (BNN) that allows some of its inputs to be stochastic, and (2) a policy optimization method based on simulated rollouts from the learned dynamics. BNN training is carried out using \alpha-divergence minimization, the specific form of which was introduced in previous work by the authors. Validation and comparison of the approach is undertaken on a simulated domain, as well as real-world scenarios. 

The paper is tightly written, and easy to follow. Its approach to fitting Bayesian neural networks with \alpha divergence is interesting and appears novel in this context. The resulting application to model-based control appears to have significant practical impact, particularly in light of the explainability that a system model can bring to specific decisions made by the policy. As such, I think that the paper brings a valuable contribution to the literature.

That said, I have a few questions and suggestions:

1) In section 2.2, it should be explained how the random z_n input is used by the neural network: is it just concatenated to the other inputs and used as-is, or is there a special treatment?

2) Moreover, much case is made for the need to have stochastic inputs, but only a scalar input seems to be provided throughout. Is this enough? How computationally difficult would providing stochastic inputs of higher dimensionality be?

3) How important is the normality assumption in z_n? How is the variance \gamma established?

4) It is mentioned that the hidden layers of the neural network are made of rectifiers, but no further utilization of this fact is made in the paper. Is this assumption somehow important in the optimization of the alpha-divergence (beyond what we know about rectifiers to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem) ?

They demonstrate good improvements on language modeling by adding this cache to RNN baselines.

The main contribution of this paper is the observation that simply using the hidden states h_i as keys for words x_i, and h_t as the query vector, naturally gives a lookup mechanism that works fine without tuning by backprop. This is a simple observation and might already exist as folk knowledge among some people, but it has nice implications for scalability and the experiments are convincing.

The basic idea of repurposing locally-learned representations for large-scale attention where backprop would normally be prohibitively expensive is an interesting one, and could probably be used to improve other types of memory networks.

263,False,Generalizable Features From Unsupervised Learning,"*** Paper Summary ***

The paper proposes to learn a predictive model (aka predict the next video frames given an input image) and uses the prediction from this model to improve a supervised classifier. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated on a tower stability dataset.

*** Review Summary ***

This work seems rather preliminary in terms of experimentation and using forward modeling as pretraining has already been proposed and applied to video and text classification tasks. Discussion on related work is insufficient. The end task choice (will there be motion?) might not be the best to advocate for unsupervised training.

*** Detailed Review ***

This work seems rather preliminary. There is no comparison with alternative semi-supervised strategies. Any approach that consider the next frames as latent variables (or privileged information) can be considered. Also I am not sure if the supervised stability prediction model is actually needed once the next frame is predicted. Basically the task can be reduced to predict whether there will be motion in the video following the current frame or not (for instance comparing the first frame and last prediction or the density of gray in the top part of the video might work just as well). Also training a model to predict the presence of motion from the unsupervised data only would probably do very well. I would suggest to stir away from task where the label can be inferred trivially from the unsupervised data, meaning that unlabeled videos can be considered labeled frames in that case.

The related work section misses a discussion on previous work on learning unsupervised features from video (through predictive models, dimensionality reduction...) for helping classification of still images or videos [Fathi et al 2008; Mabahi et al 2009; Srivastava et al 2015]. More recently, Wang and Gupta (2015) have obtained excellent ImageNet results from features pre trained on unlabeled videos. Vondrick et al (2016) have shown that generative models of video can help initialize models for video classification tasks. Also in the field of text classification, pre training of classifier with a language model is a form predictive modeling, e.g. Dai & Le 2015.

I would also suggest to report test results on the dataset from Lerrer et al 2016 (I understand that you need your own videos to pre train the predictive model) but stability prediction only require still images.

Overall, I feel the experimental section is too preliminary. It would be better to focus on a task where solving the unsupervised task does not necessarily imply that the supervised task is trivially solved (or conversely that a simple rule can turn the unlabeled data into label data).

264,False,Generalizable Features From Unsupervised Learning,"Paper Summary
This paper evaluates the ability of two unsupervised learning models to learn a
generalizable physical intuition governing the stability of a tower of blocks.
The two models are (1) A model that predicts the final state of the tower given
the initial state, and (2) A model that predicts the sequence of states of this
tower over time given the initial state. Generalizability is evaluated by
training a model on towers made of a certain number of blocks but testing on
towers made of a different number of blocks.

Strengths
- This paper explores an interesting way to evaluate representations in terms of
  their generalizability to out-of-domain data, as opposed to more standard
methods which use train and test data drawn from the same distribution.
- Experiments show that the predictions of deep unsupervised learning models on
  such out-of-domain data do seem to help, even though the models were not
trained explicitly to help in this way.

Weaknesses

- Based on Fig 4, it seems that the models trained on 3 blocks (3CD, 3CLD)
  ``generalize"" to 4 and 5 blocks.  However, it is plausible that these models
only pay attention to the bottom 3 blocks of the 4 or 5 block towers in order to
determine their stability. This would work correctly a significant fraction of
the time. Therefore, the models might actually be overfitting to 3 block towers
and not really generalizing the physics of these blocks. Is this a possibility ?
I think more careful controls are needed to make the claim that the features
actually generalize. For example, test the 3 block model on a 5 block test set
but only make the 4th or 5th block unstable. If the model still works well, then
we could argue that it is actually generalizing.

- The experimental analysis seems somewhat preliminary and can be improved. In
  particular, it would help to see visualizations of what the final state looks
like for models trained on 3 blocks but test on 5 (and vice-versa). That would
help understand if the generalization is really working. The discriminative
objective gives some indication of this, but might obfuscate some aspects of
physical realism that we would really want to test.  In Figure 1 and 2, it is
not mentioned whether these models are being tested on the same number of blocks
they were trained for.

- It seems that the task of the predicting the final state is really a binary
  task - whether or not to remove the blocks and replace them with gray
background. The places where the blocks land in case of a fall is probably quite
hard to predict, even for a human, because small perturbations can have a big
impact on the final state. It seems that in order to get a generalizable
physics model, it could help to have a high frame rate sequence prediction task.
Currently, the video is subsampled to only 5 time steps.

Quality
A more detailed analysis and careful choices of testing conditions can increase
the quality of this paper and strengthen the conclusions that can be drawn from
this work.

Clarity
The paper is well written and easy to follow.

Originality
The particular setting explored in this paper is novel.

Significance
This paper provides a valuable addition to the growing work on
transferability/generalizability as an evaluation method for unsupervised
learning. However, more detailed experiments and analysis are needed to make
this paper significant enough for an ICLR paper.

Minor comments and suggestions
- The acronym IPE is used without mentioning its expansion anywhere in the text.

- There seems to be a strong dependence on data augmentation. But given that
  this is a synthetic dataset, it is not clear why more data was not generated
in the first place.

- Table 3 : It might be better to draw this as a 9 x 3 grid : 9 rows corresponding to the
models and 3 columns corresponding to the test sets. Mentioning the train set is
redundant since it is already captured in the model name. That might make it
easier to read.

Overall
This is an excellent direction to work and preliminary results look great.
However, more controls and detailed analysis are needed to make strong
conclusions from these experiments.",,5.0,4.0
265,False,Generalizable Features From Unsupervised Learning,"Summary
===
This paper trains models to predict whether block towers will fall down
or not. It shows that an additional model of how blocks fall down
(predicting a sequence of frames via unsupervised learning) helps the original
supervised task to generalize better.

This work constructs a synthetic dataset of block towers containing
3 to 5 blocks places in more or less precarious positions. It includes both
labels (the tower falls or not) and video frame sequences of the tower's
evolution according to a physics engine.

Three kinds of models are trained. The first (S) simply takes an image of a
tower's starting state and predicts whether it will fall or not. The
other two types (CD and CLD) take both the start state and the final state of the
tower (after it has or has not fallen) and predict whether it has fallen or not,
they only differ in how the final state is provided. One model (ConvDeconv, CD)
predicts the final frame using only the start frame and the other
(ConvLSTMDeconv) predicts a series of intermediate frames before coming
to the final frame. Both CD and CLD are unsupervised.

Each model is trained on towers of a particular heigh and tested on
towers with an unseen height. When the height of the train towers
is the same as the test tower height, all models perform roughly the same
(with in a few percentage points). However, when the test height is
greater than the train height it is extremely helpful to explicitly
model the final state of the block tower before deciding whether it has
fallen or not (via CD and CLD models).


Pros
===

* There are very clear (large) gains in accuracy from adding an unsupervised
final frame predictor. Because the generalization problem is also particularly
clear (train and test with different numbers of blocks), this makes for
a very nice toy example where unsupervised learning provides a clear benefit.

* The writing is clear.


Cons
===

My one major concern is a lack of more detailed analysis. The paper
establishes a base result, but does not explore the idea to the extent
to which I think an ICLR paper should. Two general directions for potential
analysis follow:

* Is this a limitation of the particular way the block towers are rendered?

The LSTM model could be limited by the sub-sampling strategy. It looks
like the sampling may be too coarse from the provided examples. For the
two towers in figure 2 that fall, they have fallen after only 1 or 2
time steps. How quickly do most towers fall? What happens if the LSTM
is trained at a higher frame rate? What is the frame-by-frame video
prediction accuracy of the LSTM? (Is that quantity meaningful?)
How much does performance improve if the LSTM is provided ground truth
for only the first k frames?

* Why is generalization to different block heights limited?

Is it limited by model capacity or architecture design?
What would happen if the S-type models were made wider/deeper with the CD/CLD
fall predictor capacity fixed?

Is it limited by the precise task specification?
What would happen if networks were trained with towers of multiple heights
(apparently this experiment is in the works)?
I appreciate that one experiment in this direction was provided.

Is it limited by training procedure? What if the CD/CLD models were trained
in an end-to-end manner? What if the double frame fall predictor were trained
with ground truth final frames instead of generated final frames?


Minor concerns:

* It may be asking too much to re-implement Zhang et. al. 2016 and PhysNet
for the newly proposed dataset, but it would help the paper to have baselines
which are directly comparable to the proposed results. I do not think this
is a major concern because the point of the paper is about the role of
unsupervised learning rather than creating the best fall prediction network.

* The auxiliary experiment provided is motivated as follows: 
""One solution could be to train these models to predict how many blocks have
fallen instead of a binary stability label.""
Is there a clear intuition for why this might make the task easier?

* Will the dataset, or code to generate it, be released?



Overall Evaluation
===
The writing, presentation, and experiments are clear and of high enough
quality for ICLR. However the experiments provide limited analysis past
the main result (see comments above). The idea is a clear extension of ideas behind unsupervised
learning (video prediction) and recent results in intuitive physics from
Lerer et. al. 2016 and Zhang et. al. 2016, so there is only moderate novelty.
However, these results would provide a valuable addition to the literation,
especially if more analysis was provided.

266,True,Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD) for Domain-Invariant Representation Learning,"Variational auto-encoders, adversarial networks, and kernel scoring rules like MMD have recently gained popularity as methods for learning directed generative models and for other applications like domain adaptation. This paper gives an additional method along the scoring rules direction that uses the matching of central moments to match two probability distributions. The technique is simple, and in the case of domain adaptation, highly effective.

CMD seems like a very nice and straightforward solution to the domain adaptation problem. The method is computationally straightforward to implement, and seems quite stable with respect to the tuning parameters when compared to MMD. I was skeptical reading through this, especially given the fact that you only use K=5 in your experiments, but the results seem quite good. The natural question that I have now is: how will this method do in training generative models? This is beyond the scope of this paper, but it’s the lowest hanging fruit.

Below I give more detailed feedback.

One way to speed up MMD is to use a random Fourier basis as was done in “Fastmmd: Ensemble of circular discrepancy for efficient two-sample test” by Zhao and Meng, 2015. There are also linear time estimators, e.g., in “A Kernel Two-Sample Test“ by Gretton et al., 2012. I don’t think you need to compare against these approaches since you compare to the full MMD, but they should be cited.

The paper “Generative Models and Model Criticism via Optimized Maximum Mean Discrepancy” by Sutherland et al. submitted to ICLR 2017 as well, discusses techniques for optimizing the kernel used in MMD and is worth citing in section 3.

How limiting is the assumption that the distribution has independent marginals?

The sample complexity of MMD depends heavily on the dimensionality of the input space - do you have any intuitions about the sample complexity of CMD? It seems like it's relatively insensitive based on the results in Figure 4, but I would be surprised if this were the case with 10,000 hidden units. I mainly ask this because with generative models, the output space can be quite high-dimensional.

I’m concerned that the central moments won’t be numerically stable at higher orders when backpropagating. This doesn’t seem to be a problem in the experimental results, but perhaps the authors could comment a bit on this? I’m referring to the fact that ck(X) can be very large for k >= 3. Proposition 1 alleviates my concerns that the overall objective is unstable, I’m referring specifically to the individual terms within.

Figure 3 is rather cluttered, and aside from the mouse class it’s not clear to me from the visualization that the CMD regularizer is actually helping. It would be useful to remove some of the classes for the purpose of visualization.

I would like some clarification about the natural geometric interpretations of K=5. Do you mean that the moments up to K=5 have been well-studied? Do you have any references for this? Why does K >= 6 not have a natural geometric interpretation?

Figure 4 should have a legend",,9.0,5.0
267,True,Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD) for Domain-Invariant Representation Learning,"The work introduces a new regularization for learning domain-invariant representations with neural networks. The regularization aims at matching the higher order central moments of the hidden activations of the NNs of the source and target domain. The authors compared the proposed method vs MMD and two state-of-art NN domain adaptation algorithms on the Amazon review and office datasets, and showed comparable performance. 

The idea proposed is simple and straightforward, and the empirical results suggest that it is quite effective. The biggest limitation I can see with the proposed method is the assumption that the hidden activations are independently distributed. For example, this assumption will clearly be violated for the hidden activations of convolutional layers, where neighboring activations are dependent. I guess this is why the authors start with the output of dense layers for the image dataset. Do the authors have insight on if it is beneficial to start adaptation from lower level? If so, do the authors have insight on how to relax the assumption? In these scenarios, if MMD has an advantage as it does not make this assumption? 

Figure 3 does not seems to clearly support the boost of performance shown in table 2. The only class where the new regularization brings the source and target domain closer seem to be the mouse class pointed by the authors. Is the performance improvement only coming from this single class? ",,6.0,4.0
268,True,Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD) for Domain-Invariant Representation Learning,"This paper proposed a new metric central moment discrepancy (CMD) for matching two distributions, with applications to domain adaptation.  Compared to a more well-known variant, MMD, CMD has the benefit of not over penalizing the mean, and therefore can focus more on the shape of distribution around the center.

In terms of discriminative power (the ability to tell two distributions apart), MMD and CMD should be equivalent, but in practice I can understand that CMD may be better as MMD tries to match the raw moments which may over penalize data that are not zero centered.

In the paper CMD is used only up to Kth order, and not all the central moments are used, but rather only the diagonal entries are considered in the CMD objective, I think this is mostly motivated for computation efficiency.  A natural comparison with MMD therefore can be made, by also explicitly include raw moments up to Kth order.  Another thing to compare against is to include all moments, not just the diagonal terms, in the objective.  This is computationally expensive, but can be done for e.g. 1st and 2nd orders.

Since the experiments only compare CMD in the above form with kernelized MMD, the claim that explicit moment matching is helpful is not very well supported.  To make this a solid claim CMD should be compared against MMD with explicit raw moments.

The claim that the kernel parameter in MMD is hard to tune and CMD does not have such parameters only applies to kernel MMD, not explicit MMD.  For kernel MMD, there are also studies on how to set these parameters, for example:

Sriperumbudur et al.  Kernel choice and classifiability for rkhs embeddings of probability distributions.
Gretton et al.  A kernel two-sample test.

and also using multiple kernels (Li et al. 2015) which removes the need to tune them.  Tuning the beta directly like done in this paper is usually not the way MMD is tuned.  At least simple heuristics like dividing |x-y|^2 by dimensionality or mean pairwise distance first should be applied first before trying beta in the way done in this paper.

Overall I think CMD could be better than MMD, and could have applications in many domains.  But it also has the problem of not easily kernelizable (you can argue this both ways though).  The experiments demonstrating that CMD is better could be done more convincinly.

269,False,Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography,"This paper proposed to use GAN for encrypted communications.

In section 2, the authors proposed a 3 part neural network trained to encode and decode data. This model does not have any practical value except paving the way for describing the next model in section 3: it is strictly worse than any provable cryptography system.

In section 3, the authors designed a task where they want to hide part of the data, which has correlated fields, while publishing the rest. However, I'm having trouble thinking of an application where this system is better than simply decorrelating the data and encrypting the fields one wants to hide with a provable cryptography system while publishing the rest in plain text.",,4.0,2.0
270,False,Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography,"The submission proposes to modify the typical GAN architecture slightly to include ""encrypt"" (Alice) and ""decrypt"" (Bob) modules as well as a module trying to decrypt the signal without a key (Eve).  Through repeated transmission of signals, the adversarial game is intended to converge to a system in which Alice and Bob can communicate securely (or at least a designated part of the signal should be secure), while a sophisticated Eve cannot break their code.  Examples are given on toy data:
""As a proof-of-concept, we implemented Alice, Bob, and Eve networks that take N-bit random plain-text and key values, and produce N-entry floating-point ciphertexts, for N = 16, 32, and 64.  Both plaintext and key values are uniformly distributed.""

The idea considered here is cute.  If some, but not necessarily all of the signal is meant to be secure, the modules can learn to encrypt and decrypt a signal, while an adversary is simultaneously learned that tries to break the encryption.  In this way, some of the data can remain unencrypted, while the portion that is e.g. correlated with the encrypted signal will have to be encrypted in order for Eve to not be able to predict the encrypted part.

While this is a nice thought experiment, there are significant barriers to this submission having a practical impact:
1) GANs, and from the convergence figures also the objective considered here, are quite unstable to optimize.  The only guarantees of privacy are for an Eve that is converged to a very strong adversary (stronger than a dedicated attack over time).  I do not see how one can have any sort of reliable guarantee of the safety of the data transmission from the proposed approach, at least the paper does not outline such a guarantee.
2) Public key encryption systems are readily available, computationally feasible, and successfully applied almost anywhere.  The toy examples given in the paper do not at all convince me that this is solving a real-world problem at this point.  Perhaps a good example will come up in the near future, and this work will be shown to be justified, but until such an example is shown, the approach is more of an interesting thought experiment.",,5.0,4.0
271,False,Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography,"The paper deals with an interesting application of adversarial training to encryption. It considers the standard scenario of Alice, Eve and Bob, where A and B aim to exchange messages conditioned on a shared key, while Eve should be unable to encrypt the message. Experiments are performed in a simple symmetric 16 bit encryption task, and an application on privacy. The concepts, ideas and previous literature are quite nicely and carefully presented.

The only major concern I have - and I apologize to the authors for not raising this earlier - are the experiments in section 3. In particular, I don't quite get the scenario. The reasoning here seems to be as follows: given information < A, B, C, D >, I want to give the public the value of D (e.g. movies watched) without releasing information about C (e.g. gender). In this scenario, Eve would need to be able to reconstruct D as good as possible without gaining information about C. What is described in section 3, however, is that D and D-public are both reconstructed by Bob, but why would Bob reconstruct the latter (he is not public, in particular because he is allowed to reconstruct C, which is not tested here)? Also, Eve only tries to estimate C, thus rendering the scenario not different in any way to the scenario considered in section 2.

I have two more minor concerns:

1) As raised in the pre-review, Eve should actually be stronger then Alice and Bob in order to be able to compensate for the missing key. The authors noted they have been doing these experiments and are going to add the results.

2) In any natural encryption case I would expect the length of the key to be much shorter then the length of the message. This, however, could potentially make the scenario much easier for Eve (although I doubt any of the results will change if the key is long enough).

I like the creative application of adversarial training to a completely different domain, and I believe it could be the starting point of a very interesting direction in cryptographic systems or in privacy applications (although it is unclear whether the weak guarantees of neural network based approaches can ever be overcome). At the same time the application in the privacy setting leaves me quite confused, and the symmetric encryption example is not particularly strong either. I'd appreciate if the authors could address the major concern I raised above, and I will be quite happy to raise the score in case this confusion can be resolved.",,6.0,3.0
272,False,A Differentiable Physics Engine for Deep Learning in Robotics,"This paper creates a physics simulator using theano, and uses it to learn a neural network policy by back propagating gradients through the simulation. The approach is novel, and is motivated by being able to learn policies for robotics.

My two key reservations with the paper are as follows:
1. The method is motivated by learning policies for robotics. However, the proposed method is *only* useful for robotics if the learned policy can transfer the real world. Transferring policies from simulation to real-world is an open research problem, and is particularly challenging with less realistic simulators.
2. They key novelty/benefit of this approach over other model-based approaches is that the simulator is differentiable. However, the only empirical comparison in the paper is to a model-free approach (CMA-ES). To appropriately demonstrate the approach, it should be compared to other model-based approaches, which do not require analytic derivatives of the model.

For the reader to fully understand the pros and cons of the approach, the paper should also include quantitative comparison between the speed of the proposed simulator, and that of standard simulation platforms.

Because the idea is interesting and novel, I think it lies above the acceptance threshold. However, it would be significantly improved with the aforementioned comparisons.

Lastly, the writing of the paper could be improved, as it is rather informal and/or imprecise in a number of places. Here are some examples:
-- “we model the use of a neural network as a general controller for a robot” - can be more concisely phrased as something like “we model the robot controller using a neural network” or “the robot controller is modeled using a neural network""
-- “In previous research, finding a gradient…” - This is a run-on sentence.
-- “We basically jam this entire equation into” - This sentence is informal and imprecise.
-- “deep learning neural network” - the word “learning” should be omitted
-- “one big RNN, where we unfold over time” - should be “…RNN, which we unfold over time” or “…RNN, unfolded over time”

Todorov's engine (my simulator of choice) computes a dynamics step and its derivatives wrt both states and controls (using finite-differences) in less than 1ms for a *full humanoid* model (his code is available here mujoco.org/book/programming.html#saDerivative). I think this actually faster than the engine described in this paper, but I can't be sure.

Because this engine is so limited in what it can collide (sphere/sphere and sphere/plane), it would be trivial to build the example models in several other popular engines (e.g. ODE, Bullet and MuJoCo) and simply compare the performance. Until this comparison is done I consider the paper to be incomplete.",,5.0,4.0
275,False,A Differentiable Physics Engine for Deep Learning in Robotics,"Hi, it would be great if you can clarify the following.

1. Section I: ""Evaluating finite difference approximations, however, requires the same number of model evaluations as the number of parameters with respect to which is differentiated."" -- this is incorrect. If you have a differentiable policy, you only require model evaluations of the order of number of states (which are typically in 100s) and not number of parameters.

2. Have you tried comparing against numerical derivatives of the Jacobian and propagating these to find derivatives with respect to policy parameters (as opposed to jamming everything into the RNN as noted in the paper)? To me, the entire pitch of the paper lies on the former being difficult. However, the robotics literature is full of success stories where essentially one plans through a model by computing gradients using finite differences (e.g. iLQG, CIO, GPS etc).

3. How to handle cases when the dynamics is stochastic?

4. How does this compare to other gradient based methods, but estimated differently. For example, policy gradient methods like REINFORCE, Natural Policy Gradient, or TRPO?",,,

I quite like the main idea of the paper, which is based on the observation in Sec. 3.0 - that the authors find many predictable patterns in the independent evolution of weights during neural network training. It is very encouraging that a simple neural network can be used to speed up training by directly predicting weights.

However the technical quality of the current paper leaves much to be desired, and I encourage the authors to do more rigorous analysis of the approach. Here are some concrete suggestions:

- The findings in Section 3.0 which motivate the approach, should be clearly presented in the paper. Presently they are stated as anecdotes.

- A central issue with the paper is that the training of the Introspection network I is completely glossed over. How well did the training work, in terms of training, validation/test losses? How well does it need to work in order to be useful for speeding up training? These are important questions for anyone interested in this approach.

- An additional important issue is that of baselines. Would a simple linear/quadratic model also work instead of a neural network? What about a simple heuristic rule to increase/decrease weights? I think it's important to compare to such baselines to understand the complexity of the weight evolution learned by the neural network.

- I do not think that default tensorflow example hyperparameters should be used, as mentioned by authors on OpenReview. There is no scientific basis for using them. Instead, first hyperparameters which produce good results in a reasonable time should be selected as the baseline, and then added the benefit of the introspection network to speed up training (and reaching a similar result) should be shown.

- The authors state in the discussion on OpenReview that they also tried RNNs as the introspection network but it didn't work with small state size. What does ""didn't work"" mean in this context? Did it underfit? I find it hard to imagine that a large state size would be required for this task. Even if it is, that doesn't rule out evaluation due to memory issues because the RNN can be run on the weights in 'mini-batch' mode. In general, I think other baselines are more important than RNN.

- A question about jump points: 
The I is trained on SGD trajectories. While using I to speed up training at several jump points, if the input weights cross previous jump points, then I gets input data from a weight evolution which is not from SGD (it has been altered by I). This seems problematic but doesn't seem to affect your experiments. I feel that this again highlights the importance of the baselines. Perhaps I is doing something extremely simple that is not affected by this issue.

280,True,Variational Lossy Autoencoder,"The AR prior and its equivalent - the inverse AR posterior - is one of the more elegant ways to improve the unfortunately poor generative qualities of VAE-s. It is only an incremental but important step. Incremental, because, judging by the lack of, say, CIFAR10 pictures of the VLAE in its ""creative"" regime ( i.e., when sampling from prior), it will not answer many of the questions hanging over. We hope to see the paper accepted: in relative terms, the paper shines in the landscape of the other papers which are rich on engineering hacks but lacking on theoretical insights.

Some disagreements with the theoretical suppositions in the paper:

i) The VAE-s posterior converges to the prior faster than we would like because the gradients of the ""generative"" error (the KL divergence of prior and posterior) w.r.t. mu & sigma are simple, inf differentiable functions and their magnitude far exceeds the magnitude of the resp. gradients of the reconstruction error. Especially when more ""hairy"" decoders like pixelCNN are used. We always considered this obvious and certainly not worthy of one page of CS mumbo-jumbo to explain. Dumbing-down the decoder via variations of dropout or ""complexifying"" the sampler as in here, or slapping the generative error with a ""DeepMind"" constant (beta_VAE), are the natural band-aids, but seem to fail in the ""creative"" regime, for real-life sets like CIFAR10 or more complex ones. Other conceptual solutions are needed, some are discussed in [2].

ii) The claim near the end of section 2.2 that ""the extra coding cost a.k.a. variational error will exist and will not be negligible"" is a speculation, which, in our empirical experience at least, is incorrect. The variational error is quantifiable for the Gibbs/exponential family of priors/posteriors, as described in [1], section 3.8, and as Tim Salimans knows from his own previous work. In the case of CIFAR10 for example, the variational error is negligible, even for simple sampling families like Gaussian, Laplacian, etc. Moreover, in hindsight, using the closed-form for generative error (the KL divergence of prior and posterior) in the pioneering VAE papers, was likely a mistake inherited by the unnecessary Bayseanism which inspired them (beautiful but a mistake nonetheless): The combo of generative and variational error should together be approximated by the same naive Monte Carlo used for the reconstruction error (easily follows from equation (3.13) in [1]) i.e. arithmetic average over observations.

On the lighter side, guys, please do not recycle ridiculous terms like ""optimizationally challenged"", as in section 2.2! The English language has recently acquired ""mentally-challenged"", ""emotionally-challenged"", etc, and now political correctness has sadly found its way to machines?

Being open about what the approach really does would also seem useful.",,,
282,True,Variational Lossy Autoencoder,"This paper proposes a Variational Autoencoder model that can discard information found irrelevant, in order to learn interesting global representations of the data. This can be seen as a lossy compression algorithm, hence the name Variational Lossy Autoencoder. To achieve such model, the authors combine VAEs with neural autoregressive models resulting in a model that has both a latent variable structure and a powerful recurrence structure.

The authors first present an insightful Bits-Back interpretation of VAE to show when and how the latent code is ignored. As it was also mentioned in the literature, they say that the autoregressive part of the model ends up explaining all structure in the data, while the latent variables are not used. Then, they propose two complementary approaches to force the latent variables to be used by the decoder. The first one is to make sure the autoregressive decoder only uses small local receptive field so the model has to use the latent code to learn long-range dependency. The second is to parametrize the prior distribution over the latent code with an autoregressive model.

They also report new state-of-the-art results on binarized MNIST (both dynamical and statically binarization), OMNIGLOT and Caltech-101 Silhouettes.

Review:
The bits-Back interpretation of VAE is a nice contribution to the community. Having novel interpretations for a model helps to better understand it and sometimes, like in this paper, highlights how it can be improved.

Having a fine-grained control over the kind of information that gets included in the learned representation can be useful for a lot of applications. For instance, in image retrieval, such learned representation could be used to retrieve objects that have similar shape no matter what texture they have.

However, the authors say they propose two complementary classes of improvements to VAE, that is the lossy code via explicit information placement (Section 3.1) and learning the prior with autoregressive flow (Section 3.2). However, they never actually showed how a VAE without AF prior but that has a PixelCNN decoder performs. What would be the impact on the latent code is no AF prior is used?

Also, it is not clear if WindowAround(i) represents only a subset of x_{",,7.0,4.0
283,True,Variational Lossy Autoencoder,"This paper introduces the notion of a ""variational lossy autoencoder"", where a powerful autoregressive conditional distribution on the inputs x given the latent code z is crippled in a way that forces it to use z in a meaningful way. Its three main contributions are:

(1) It gives an interesting information-theoretical insight as to why VAE-type models don't tend to take advantage of their latent representation when the conditional distribution on x given z is powerful enough.

(2) It shows that this insight can be used to efficiently train VAEs with powerful autoregressive conditional distributions such that they make use of the latent code.

(3) It presents a powerful way to parametrize the prior in the form of an autoregressive flow transformation which is equivalent to using an inverse autoregressive flow transformation on the approximate posterior.

By itself, I think the information-theoretical explanation of why VAEs do not use their latent code when the conditional distribution on x given z is powerful enough constitutes an excellent addition to our understanding of VAE-related approaches.

However, the way this intuition is empirically evaluated is a bit weak. The ""crippling"" method used feels hand-crafted and very task-dependent, and the qualitative evaluation of the ""lossyness"" of the learned representation is carried out on three datasets (MNIST, OMNIGLOT and Caltech-101 Silhouettes) which feature black-and-white images with little-to-no texture. Figures 1a and 2a do show that reconstructions discard low-level information, as observed in the slight variations in strokes between the input and the reconstruction, but such an analysis would have been more compelling with more complex image datasets. Have the authors tried applying VLAE to such datasets?

I think the Caltech101 Silhouettes benchmark should be treated with caution, as no comparison is made against other competitive approaches like IAF VAE, PixelRNN and Conv DRAW. This means that VLAE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in only one of the four settings examined.

A question which is very relevant to this paper is ""Does a latent representation on top of an autoregressive model help improve the density modeling performance?"" The paper touches this question, but very briefly: the only setting in which VLAE is compared against recent autoregressive approaches shows that it wins against PixelRNN by a small margin.

The proposal to transform the latent code with an autoregressive flow which is equivalent to parametrizing the approximate posterior with an inverse autoregressive flow transformation is also interesting. There is, however, one important distinction to be made between the two approaches: in the former, the prior over the latent code can potentially be very complex whereas in the latter the prior is limited to be a simple, factorized distribution.

It is not clear to me that having a very powerful prior is necessarily a good thing from a representation learning point of view: oftentimes we are interested in learning a representation of the data distribution which is untangled and composed of roughly independent factors of variation. The degree to which this can be achieved using something as simple as a spherical gaussian prior is up for discussion, but finding a good balance between the ability of the prior to fit the data and its usefulness as a high-level representation certainly warrants some thought. I would be interested in hearing the authors' opinion on this.

Overall, the paper introduces interesting ideas despite the flaws outlined above, but weaknesses in the empirical evaluation prevent me from recommending its acceptance.

Specifically, we found that without using ""word dropout"" in the decoder, which effectively weakens the decoder model and forces the global variable to encode more information, we would not learn a useful latent variable. In our Figure 3, we show the results of using different amounts of word dropout and how the proportional split between the global latent code KL and the p(x|z) likelihood changes, even though the total lower bound always gets worse. This indicates that the word dropout is not simply optimizing the same model better, but is giving us a tradeoff between global and local coding.

We also note that the factorized p(x|z) used in the independent pixel decoding models of previous work forces the model to use the latent variable to achieve good likelihoods, as you mention in Section 2.2.

###

This paper proposes a hierarchical framework of transfer learning for sequence tagging, which is expected to help the target task with the source task, by sharing as many levels of representation as possible. It is a general framework for various neural models. The paper has extensive and solid experiments, and the performance is competitive with the state of the art on multiple benchmark datasets. The framework is clear by itself, except that more details about training procedure, i.e. sec-3.3, need to be added. 

The experimental results show that for some task pairs {s,t}, this framework can help low-resource target task t, and the improvement increases with more levels of representations can be shared. Firstly, I suggest that the terms *source* and *target* should be more precisely defined in the current framework, because, due to Sec-3.3, the s and t in each pair are sort of interchangeable. That is, either of them can be the *source* or *target* task, especially when p(X=s)=p(X=t)=0.5 is used in the task sampling. The difference is: one is low-resourced and the other is not. Thus it could be thought of as multi-tasking between tasks with imbalanced resource. So one question is: does this framework simultaneously help both tasks in the pair, by learning more generalizable representations for different domains/applications/languages? Or is it mostly likely to only help the low-resourced one? Does it come with sacrifice on the high-resourced side? 

Secondly, as the paper shows that the low-resourced tasks are improved for the selected task pairs, it would also be interesting and helpful to know how often this could happen. That is, when the tasks are randomly paired (one chosen from a low-resource pool and the other from a high resource pool), how often could this framework help the low-resourced one?

Moreover, the choice of T-A/T-B/T-C lies intuitively in how many levels of representation *could* be shared as possible. This implicitly assumes share more, help more. Although I tend to believe so, it would be interesting to have some empirical comparison. For example, one could perhaps select some cross-domain pair, and see if T-A > T-B > T-C on such pairs, as mentioned in the author’s answer to the pre-review question.

- The use of OBs is novel and interesting.
- Clearly written and explained.

Cons:
- No comparison to previous state of the art, only with author-generated results. 
- More ablation studies needed -- i.e. fill in Table3 with rnn0,1 rnn0,1,2 rnn0,1' etc etc. It is not clear where the performance is coming from, as it seems that it is single character modelling (0) and word endings (') that are actually beneficial.
- While the use of Open bigrams is novel, there are works which use bag of bigrams and ngrams as models which are not really compared to or explored. E.g.",,5.0,5.0
291,False,Cortical-Inspired Open-Bigram Representation for Handwritten Word Recognition,"This paper uses an LSTM model to predict what it calls ""open bigrams"" (bigrams of characters that may or may not have letters inbetween) from handwriting data. These open bigrams are subsequently used to predict the written word in a decoding step. The experiments indicate that the system does slightly better than a baseline model that uses Viterbi decoding. I have some major concerns about this paper:

- I find the ""cortical inspired"" claim troublesome. If anything, it is psychology/cognitive science inspired, in the sense that open bigrams appear to help for word recognition (Touzet et al. 2014). But the implied cortical characteristics, implicitly referred to e.g. by pointing to analogies between deep neural nets for object recognition and in that case the visual cortex, is unfounded. Is there any direct evidence from neuroscience that open-bigrams constitute a wholly separate layer in the cortex for a handwriting recognition task? Dehaene's work is a proposal, so you'll need to describe more ""findings in cognitive neurosciences [sic] research on reading"" (p. 8) to substantiate those claims. I am further worried by the fact that the authors seem to think that ""deep neural networks are based on a series of about five pairs of neurons [sic] layers"". Unless I misunderstand something, you are specifically referring to Krizhevsky's AlexNet here (which you should probably have cited there)? I hope you don't mean to imply that all deep neural nets need five layers. It is also not true that ten is ""quite close to the number of layers of an efficient deep NN"" -- what network? what task? etc.

- The model is not clearly explained. There is a short paragraph in Appendix A.3. that roughly describes the setup, but this does not include e.g. the objective function, or answer why the network output is only considered each two consecutive time steps, rather than at each time step (or so it seems?). This is probably because the paper argues that it ""is focused on the decoder"" (p. 6), rather than on the whole problem. I find this problematic, because in that case we're effectively measuring how easy it is to reconstruct a word from its open bigrams, which has very little to do with handwriting recognition (it could have been evaluated on any text corpus). In fact, as the example on page 4 shows, handwriting is not necessary to illustrate the open bigram hypothesis. Which leads me to wonder why these particular tasks were chosen, if we are only interested in the decoding mechanism?

- The comparison is not really fair. The Viterbi decoder only has access to unigrams, as far as I can tell. The only model that does better than that baseline has access to a lot more information, and does not do that much better. Did the Viterbi model have access to the word boundary information (at one point rather confusingly called ""extremities"") that pushed the open bigram model over the edge in terms of performance? Why is there no comparison to e.g. rnn_0,1' (unigram+bigram+boundary markers)? The dataset also appears to be biased in favor of the proposed approach (longer words, only ). I am not convinced that this paper really shows that open bigrams help.

I very much like the idea of the paper, but I am simply not convinced by its claims.

Minor points:
- There are quite a few typos. Just a sample: ""independant"" (Fig.1), ""we evaluate an handwritten"", "", hand written words [..], an the results"", ""their approach include"", ""the letter bigrams of a word w is"", ""for the two considered database""
- Wouldn't it be easy to add how many times a bigram occurs, which would improve the decoding process? You can just normalize over the full counts instead of the binary occurrence counts.

It would be desirable to see the model complexity of all the different models used here, i.e. the number of parameters used.

Language models are not used here. Since the different models utilize different levels of context, language models can be expected to have a different effect on the different approaches. Therefore I suggest to include the use of language models into the evaluation.

For your comparative experiments you use only 70% of the data by choosing longer words only. On the other hand, it is well known that the shorter words are more prone to result in misrecognitions. The question remains, if this choice is advantageous for one of the tasks, or not - corresponding quantitative results should be provided to be able to better evaluate the effect of using this constrained corpus. Without clarification of this I would not readily agree that the error rates are competitive or better than the standard approach, as stated at the end of Sec. 5.

I do see the motivation for introducing open-bigrams in an unordered way due to the corresponding evidence from cognitive research. However, decision theoretically I wonder, why the order should be given up, if the underlying sequential classification problem clearly is of a monotonous nature. It would be interesting to see an experiment, where only the use of the order is varied, to differentiate the effect of the order from the effect of other aspects of the approach.

At least, the column for order 0 should be visually separated to highlight this.

The units within a group are forced to be maximally similar, at the same time the units from different groups are encouraged to be orthogonal. While I like the motivation of the approach, the empirical analysis provided in the paper doesn’t look particularly convincing.

My main concerns are the following:

1. The method is sensitive to the values of alpha and beta and a poor choice of those hyperparameters can lead to a quite drastic drop in performance comparing the minor gains one gets when alpha and beta are set properly.

2. It seems strange that the best performance is obtained when the group's size ratio is 0.5. From the figures in the paper, it follows that usually, one has more “orthogonal” groups in a filter bank. I have an impression that the empirical evidence doesn’t align well with the motivation of the proposed approach.

3. The paper contains a significant amount of typos and incorrectly formatted references. There are also several places in the manuscript that I found hard to understand due to unusual phrasing.

I would like to thank the authors for answering/addressing my pre-review questions. I would be grateful if the authors could provide more clarifications of the following:

1. Question 2: I’m not sure if modifying \theta_{map} alone would result in any learning at all. Do I understand correctly that \theta_{map} is only used to define groups? If so, then I don’t see how the proposed method can be used in the purely unsupervised regime.

2. Question 3: I was not referring to the fixed clustering based on the filter of the pre-trained network. One can perform that clustering at every step of the k-shot learning process. I’m not sure I understand why the authors visualize grouping of _filters_ while in the actual algorithm they group _activations_. 

Overall, the paper is quite interesting but needs a stronger empirical justification of the approach as well as a better presentation of the material.",,4.0,4.0
296,False,Sampling Generative Networks,"In this paper the authors propose various techniques to sample visualizations from generative models with high dimensional latent spaces like VAEs and GANs. For example, the authors highlight the well known but often not sufficiently appreciated fact that the probability mass of high dimensional Gaussian distributions concentrates near a thin hyper-shell with a certain radius. They therefore propose to use spherical interpolations (great arcs) instead of the commonly used linear interpolations. In a similar spirit they propose a visualisation for analogies and techniques to reinforce structure in VAE latent spaces.

I find it hard to give clear recommendation for this paper: On the one hand I enjoyed reading it and I might want use some of the proposals (e.g. spherical interpolations; J-diagrams) in future work of mine. On the other hand, it’s obvious that this paper is not a typical machine learning paper; it does not propose a new model, or training method, or provide (theoretical/empirical) insight and it does not have the scientific quality and depth I’ve seen in many other ICLR submissions. But it does more than just describing useful “tricks”. And all things considered I think this paper deserves a wider audience (but  I'm not convinced that ICLR is the right venue)",,6.0,3.0

The techniques proposed are simple, well explained, and of immediate use to those working on generative models. However, I'm not sure the paper is appropriate for an ICLR conference track as it doesn't provide any greater theoretical insights into sampling generative models and there are no comparisons / quantitative evaluations of the techniques proposed. Overall, I'm very much on the fence since I think the techniques are useful and this paper should be read by those interested in generating modeling. I would be willing to increase my core if the author could present a case for why ICLR is an appropriate venue for this work.",,5.0,4.0
298,False,Sampling Generative Networks,"This paper proposed a set of different things under the name of ""sampling generative models"", focusing on analyzing the learned latent space and synthesizing desirable output images with certain properties for GANs.  This paper does not have one single clear message or idea, but rather proposed a set of techniques that seem to produce visually good looking results.  While this paper has some interesting ideas, it also has a number of problems.

The spherical interpolation idea is interesting, but after a second thought this does not make much sense.  The proposed slerp interpolation equation (page 2) implicitly assumes that the two points q1 and q2 lie on the same sphere, in which case the parameter theta is the angle corresponding to the great arc connecting the two points on the sphere.  However, the latent space of a GAN, no matter trained with a uniform distribution or a Gaussian distribution, is not a distribution on a sphere, and many points have different distances to the origin.  The author's justification for this comes from the well known fact that in high dimensional space, even with a uniform distribution most points lie on a thin shell in the unit cube.  This is true because in high-dimensional space, the outer shell takes up most of the volume in space, and the inner part takes only a very small fraction of the space, in terms of volume.  This does not mean the density of data in the outer shell is greater than the inner part, though.  In a uniform distribution, the data density should be equal everywhere, a point on the outer shell is not more likely than a point in the inner part.  Under a Gaussian model, the data density is on the other hand higher in the center and much lower on the out side.  If we have a good model of data, then sampling the most likely points from the model should give us plausible looking samples.  In this sense, spherical interpolation should do no better than the normally used linear interpolation.  From the questions and answers it seems that the author does not recognize this distinction.  The results shown in this paper seem to indicate that spherical interpolation is better visually, but it is rather hard to make any concrete conclusions from three pairs of examples.  If this is really the case then there must be something else wrong about our understanding of the learned model.

Aside from these, the J-diagram and the nearest neighbor latent space traversal both seems to be good ways to explore the latent space of a learned model.  The attribute vector section on transforming images to new ones with desired attributes is also interesting, and it provides a few new ways to make the GAN latent space more interpretable.

Overall I feel most of the techniques proposed in this paper are nice visualization tools.  The contributions however, are mostly on the design of the visualizations, and not much on the technical and model side.  The spherical interpolation provides the only mathematical equation in the paper, yet the correctness of the technique is arguable.  For the visualization tools, there are also no quantitative evaluation, maybe these results are more art than science.",,5.0,3.0

The experiments are well done and the results are encouraging. Of course, more experiments would be even nicer, but is it ever not the case?

My question/issue - is the proposed pruning criterion proposed? Yes, pruning on the filter level is what in my opinion is the way to go, but I would be curious how the ""min sum of weights"" criterion compares to other approaches.

Pros:
- Creates *structured* sparsity, which automatically improves performance without changing the underlying convolution implementation
- Very simple to implement

Cons:
- No evaluation of how pruning impacts transfer learning

I'm generally positive about this work. While the main idea is almost trivial, I am not aware of any other papers that propose exactly the same idea and show a good set of experimental results. Therefore I'm inclined to accept it. The only major downside is that the paper does not evaluate the impact of filter pruning on transfer learning. For example, there is not much interest in the tasks of CIFAR10 or even ImageNet. Instead, the main interest in both academia and industry is the value of the learned representation for transferring to other tasks. One might expect filter pruning (or any other kind of pruning) to harm transfer learning. It's possible that the while the main task has about the same performance, transfer learning is strongly hurt. This paper has missed an opportunity to explore that direction.

304,False,Layer Recurrent Neural Networks,"The paper proposes a method of integrating recurrent layers within larger, potentially pre-trained, convolutional networks. The objective is to combine the feature extraction abilities of CNNs with the ability of RNNs to gather global context information.
The authors validate their idea on two tasks, image classification (on CIFAR-10) and semantic segmentation (on PASCAL VOC12).

On the positive side, the paper is clear and well-written (apart from some occasional typos), the proposed idea is simple and could be adopted by other works, and can be deployed as a beneficial perturbation of existing systems, which is practically important if one wants to increase the performance of a system without retraining it from scratch. The evaluation is also systematic, providing a clear ablation study. 

On the negative side, the novelty of the work is relatively limited, while the validation is lacking a bit. 
Regarding novelty, the idea of combining a recurrent layer with a CNN, something practically very similar was proposed in Bell et al (2016). There are a few technical differences (e.g. cascading versus applying in parallel the recurrent layers), but in my understanding these are minor changes. The idea of initializing the recurrent network with the CNN is reasonable but is at the level of improving one wrong choice in the original work of Bell, rather than really proposing something novel. 
This contribution ("" we use RNNs within layers"") is repeatedly mentioned in the paper (including intro &  conclusion), but in my understanding was part of Bell et al, modulo minor changes. 

Regarding the evaluation, experiments on CIFAR are interesting, but only as proof of concept. 

Furthermore, as noted in my early question, Wide Residual Networks (Sergey Zagoruyko, Nikos Komodakis, BMVC16)
report  better results on CIFAR-10 (4% error), while not using any recurrent layers (rather using instead a wide, VGG-type, ResNet variant). So. 
The authors answer: ""Wide Residual Networks use the depth of the network to spread the receptive field across the entire image (DenseNet (Huang et al., 2016) similarly uses depth). Thus there is no need for recurrence within layers to capture contextual information. In contrast, we show that a shallow CNN, where the receptive field would be limited, can capture contextual information within the whole image if a L-RNN is used.""

So, we agree that WRN do not need recurrence - and can still do better. 
The point of my question has practically been whether using a recurrent layer is really necessary; I can understand the answer as being ""yes, if you want to keep your network shallow"".  I do not necessarily see why one would want to keep one's network shallow.

Probably an evaluation on imagenet would bring some more insight about the merit of this layer. 


Regarding semantic segmentation, one of my questions has been:
""Is the boost you are obtaining due to something special to the recurrent layer, or is simply because one is adding extra parameters on top of a pre-trained network? (I admit I may have missed some details of your experimental evaluation)""
The answer was:
""...For PASCAL segmentation, we add the L-RNN into a pre-trained network (this adds recurrence parameters), and again show that this boosts performance - more so than adding the same number of parameters as extra CNN layers - as it is able to model long-range dependences""
I could not find one such experiment in the paper ('more so than adding the same number of parameters as extra CNN layers'); I understand that you have 2048 x 2048 connections for the recurrence, it would be interesting to see what you get by spreading them over (non-recurrent) residual layers.
Clearly, this is not going to be my criterion for rejection/acceptance, since one can easily make it fail - but I was mostly asking for some sanity check 

Furthermore, it is a bit misleading to put in Table 3 FCN-8s and FCN8s-LRNN, since this gives the impression that the LRNN gives a  boost by 10%. In practice the ""FCN8s"" prefix of ""FCN8s-LRNN"" is that of the authors, and not of Long et al (as indicated in Table 2, 8s original is quite worse than 8s here). 

Another thing that is not clear to me is where the boost comes from in Table 2; the authors mention that ""when inserting the L-RNN after pool 3 and pool4 in FCN-8s, the L-RNN is able to learn contextual information over a much larger range than the receptive field of pure local convolutions. ""
This is potentially true, but I do not see why this was not also the case for FCN-32s (this is more a property of the recurrence rather than the 8/32 factor, right?)

A few additional points: 
It seems like Fig 2b and Fig2c never made it into the pdf. 

Figure 4 is unstructured and throws some 30 boxes to the reader - I would be surprised if anyone is able to get some information out of this (why not have a table?) 

Appendix A: this is very mysterious. Did you try other learning rate schedules? (e.g. polynomial)
What is the performance if you apply a standard training schedule? (e.g. step).

305,False,Layer Recurrent Neural Networks,"This paper proposes a cascade of paired (left/right, up/down) 1D RNNs as a module in CNNs in order to quickly add global context information to features without the need for stacking many convolutional layers. Experimental results are presented on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.

Pros:
- The paper is very clear and easy to read.
- Enough details are given that the paper can likely be reproduced with or without source code.
- Using 1D RNNs inside CNNs is a topic that deserves more experimental exploration than what exists in the literature.

Cons (elaborated on below):
(1) Contributions relative to, e.g. Bell et al., are minor.
(2) Disappointed in the actual use of the proposed L-RNN module versus how it's sold in the intro.
(3) Classification experiments are not convincing.

(1,2): The introduction states w.r.t. Bell et al. ""more substantial differences are two fold: first, we treat the L-RNN module as a general block, that can be inserted into any layer of a modern architecture, such as into a residual module. Second, we show (section 4) that the
L-RNN can be formulated to be inserted into a pre-trained FCN (by initializing with zero recurrence
matrices), and that the entire network can then be fine-tuned end-to-end.""

I felt positive about these contributions after reading the intro, but then much less so after reading the experimental sections. Based on the first contribution (""general block that can be inserted into any layer""), I strongly expected to see the L-RNN block integrated throughout the CNN starting from near the input. However, the architectures for classification and segmentation only place the module towards the very end of the network. While not exactly the same as Bell et al. (there are many technical details that differ), it is close. The paper does not compare to the design from Bell et al. Is there any advantage to the proposed design? Or is it a variation that performs similarly? What happens if L-RNN is integrated earlier in the network, as suggested by the introduction?

The second difference is a bit more solid, but still does not rise to a 'substantive difference' in my view. Note that Bell et al. also integrate 1D RNNs into an ImageNet pretrained VGG-16 model. I do, however, think that the method of integration proposed in this paper (zero initialization) may be more elegant and does not require two-stage training by first freezing the lower layers and then later unfreezing them.

(3) I am generally skeptical of the utility of classification experiments on CIFAR-10 when presented in isolation (e.g., no results on ImageNet too). The issue is that CIFAR-10 is not interesting as a task unto itself *and* methods that work well on CIFAR-10 do not necessarily generalize to other tasks. ImageNet has been useful because, thus far, it produces features that generalize well to other tasks. Showing good results on ImageNet is much more likely to demonstrate a model that learns generalizable features. However, that is not even necessarily true, and ideally I would like to see that that a model that does well on ImageNet in fact transfers its benefit to at least one other ask (e.g., detection).

One additional issue with the CIFAR experiments is that I expect to see a direct comparison of models A-F with and without L-RNN. It is hard to understand from the presented results if L-RNN actually adds much. In sum, I have a hard time taking away any valuable information from the CIFAR experiments.

306,False,Layer Recurrent Neural Networks,"The authors propose the use of a vertical and horizontal one-dimensional RNN (denoted as L-RNN module) to capture long-range dependencies and summarize convolutional feature maps. L-RNN modules are an alternative to deeper or wider networks, 2D RNNs, dilated (Atrous) convolutional layers, and a simple flatten or global pooling layer when applied to the last convolutional layer for classification. L-RNN modules are faster than 2D RNNs, since rows and columns can be processed in parallel, are easy to implemented, and can be inserted in existing convolutional networks. The authors demonstrate improvements for classification and semantic segmentation.

However, further evaluations are required that show for which use cases L-RNNs are superior to alternatives for summarizing convolutional feature maps:

1. I suggest to use a fixed CNN with as certain number of layers, and summarize the last feature map by a) a flatten layer, b) global average pooling, c) a 2D RNN, d) and dilated convolutional layers for segmentation. The authors should report both the run-time and number of parameters for these variants in addition to prediction performances. For segmentation, the number of dilated convolutional layers should be chosen such that the number of parameters is similar to a single L-RNN module.

2. The authors compare classification performances only on 32x32 CIFAR-10 images. For higher resolution images, the benefit of L-RNN modules to capture long-range dependencies might be more pronounced. I therefore suggest evaluating classification performances on one additional dataset with higher resolution images, e.g. ImageNet or the CUB bird dataset.

Additionally, I have the following minor comments:

3. The authors use vanilla RNNs. It might be worth investigating LSTMs or GRUs instead.

4. For classification, the authors summarize hidden states of the final vertical recurrent layer by global max pooling. Is this different from more common global average pooling or concatenating the final forward and backward recurrent states?

5. Table 3 is hard to understand since it mingles datasets (Pascal P and COCO C) and methods (CRF post-processing). I suggest, e.g., using an additional column with CRF ‘yes’ or ‘no’. I further suggest listing the number of parameters and runtime if possible.

6. Section 3 does not clearly describe in which order batch-normalization is applied in residual blocks. Figure 2 suggest that the newer BN-ReLU-Conv order described in He et al. (2016) is used. This should be mentioned in the text.

Finally, the text needs to be revised to reach publication level quality. Specifically, I have the following comments:

7. Equation (1) is the update of a vanilla RNN, which should be stated more clearly. I suggest to first describe (bidirectional) RNNs, to reference GRUs and LSTMs, and then describe how they are applied here to images. Figure 1 should also be referenced in the text.

8. In section 2.2, I suggest to describe Bell at al. more clearly. Why are they using eight instead of four RNNs? 

9. Section 4 starts with a verbose description about transfer learning, which can be compressed into a single reference or skipped entirely.

10. Equation (6) seems to be missing an index i.

11.In particular section 5 and 6 contain a lot of clutter and slang, which should be avoided:
11.1 page 8: ‘As can be seen’, ‘we turn to that case next’
11.2 page 9: ‘to the very high value’, ‘as noted earlier’,  ‘less context to contribute here’

* comparing a ResNet block with two recurrent layers as proposed with two dilated convolutional layers, which have recently been shown powerful for segmentation?
* evaluating L-RNN on other data sets than CIFAR-10, in particular using images of a higher resolution? The performance gain via L-RNN should be more pronounced for images larger than 32x32 at the cost of a higher runtime.

In your classification architectures, is it right that you are performing global max-pooling after the L-RNN layer? Did you try global average pooling or using the last hidden states of the recurrent layers?

I'm also not bothered that the dataset is synthetic, but it would be good to have more experiments with real data, as well. 

I think the paper goes too far in linking itself to human vision. I would prefer the intro not have as much cognitive science or neuroscience. The second to fourth paragraphs of the intro in particular feels like it over-stating the contribution of this paper as somehow revealing some truth about human vision. Really, the narrative is much simpler -- ""we often want deep feature representations that are viewpoint invariant. We supervise a deep network accordingly. Humans also have some capability to be viewpoint invariant which has been widely studied [citations]"". I am skeptical of any claimed connections bigger than that.

(2014),  the paper also proposed to use a recurrent fashion to mimic the sequential behavior the  human visual system. 

I think the paper is well motivated. However, there are several concerns:
1. The baselines of the paper are too weak. Nearest neighbor, bilinear, bicubic and cubic interpolations without any learning procedure are of course performed worse than AE based models. The author should compare with the STOA methods such as",,5.0,5.0

This is done by manipulating the input image x in various ways (e.g. downsamplig, foveating), and training an auto-encoder to reconstruct the original full-resolution image.  MSE and qualitative results are shown and compared for the different input conditions.

Unfortunately, this paper seems to lack focus, presenting a set of preliminary inspections with few concrete conclusions.  For example, at the end of sec 4.4, ""This result is not surprising, given that FOV-R contains additional information .... These results suggests that a small number of foveations containing rich details might be all these neural networks need...."".  But this hypothesis is left dangling:  What detailed regions are needed, and from where?  For what sort of tasks?

Secondly, it isn't clear to me what reconstruction behaviors are caused by a fundamental perception of the input, and what are artifacts of the autoencoder and pixelwise l2 loss?  A prime example is texture, which the autoencoder fails to recover.  But with a pixelwise loss, the network must predict high-frequency textures nearly pixel-for-pixel at training time; if this is impossible, then it will generate a pixelwise average of the training samples --- a flat region.  So then the network's inability to reconstruct textures is due to a problem generating them, specifically averaging from the training loss, not necessarily an issue in perceiving textures.  A network trained a different way (perhaps an adversarial network) may infer a texture is there, even if it wouldn't be able to generate it in a pixelwise l2 sense.

Similarly, the ability to perform color reconstruction given a color glimpse I think has much to do with disambiguating the color of an object/scene:  If there is an ambiguity, the network won't know which to ""choose"" (white flower or yellow flower?) and output an average, which is why there are so many sepia tones.  However, in its section on this, the paper only measures the reconstruction error for different amounts of color given, and does not drill very far into any hypotheses for why this behavior occurs.

There are some interesting measurements here, such as the amount of color needed in the foveation to reconstruct a color image, and the discussion on global features, which may start to get at a mechanism by which glimpses may propagate to an entire reconstruction.  But overall it's hard to know what to take away from this paper.  What are larger concrete conclusions that can be garnered from the details, and what mechanisms bring them about?  Can these be more thoroughly explored with more focus?

313,False,Filling in the details: Perceiving from low fidelity visual input,"I like the idea the paper is exploring. Nevertheless I see some issues with the analysis:

- To get a better understanding of the quality of the results, I think at least some state-of-the-art comparisons should be included (e.g. by setting d times d pixel patches too their average and applying a denoising autoencoder). If they perform significantly better, then this indicates that the presented model is not yet taking all the information from the input image that could be used.
- SCT-R and FOV-R are supposed to test how much information can be restored from the Fovea alone as opposed to the Fovea together with low resolution periphery. However, there is an additional difference between the two conditions: According to the paper, in SCT-R, part of the image was set to zero, while in FOV-R it was removed alltogether. With only one or two hidden layers, I could easily imagine this making a difference.
- On page 4, you compare the performance of FOV-R (1% error) with that of DS-D (1.5%) and attribute this to information about the periphery that the autoencoder extracts from the fovea. While this might be the case, at least part of the reduced error will be due to the fact that the fovea is (hopefully) perfectly reconstructed. To answer the actual question ""how much additional information about the periphery can be extracted from the fovea"", you should consider calculating the error only in the periphery, i.e. the part of the image where DS-D and FOV-R got exactly the same input for. Then any decreased error is only due to the additional fovea information.

Other issues:
- The images in Figure 2 (a) and (b) in the rows ""factor 2"", ""factor 4"", ""factor 8"" look very blurry. There seems some interpolation to be going on (although slighly different than the bilinear interpolation). This makes it hard to asses how much information is in these images. I think it would be much more insightfull to print them with ""nearest"" interpolation.
- Figure 3 caption too vague. Maybe add something like footnote 2?
- Often figures appear too early in paper which leads to lots of distance between text and figures.

314,False,Neural Machine Translation with Latent Semantic of Image and Text,"I have problems understanding the motivation of this paper. The authors claimed to have captured a latent representation of text and image during training and can translate better without images at test time, but didn't demonstrate convincingly that images help (not to mention the setup is a bit strange when there are no images at test time). What I see are only speculative comments: ""we observed some gains, so these should come from our image models"". The qualitative analysis doesn't convince me that the models have learned latent representations; I am guessing the gains are due to less overfitting because of the participation of images during training. 

The dataset is too small to experiment with NMT. I'm not sure if it's fair to compare their models with NMT and VNMT given the following description in Section 4.1 ""VNMT is fine-tuned by NMT and our models are fine-tuned with VNMT"". There should be more explanation on this.

Besides, I have problems with the presentation of this paper.
(a) There are many symbols being used unnecessary. For example: f & g are used for x (source) and y (target) in Section 3.1. 
(b) The ' symbol is not being used in a consistent manner, making it sometimes hard to follow the paper. For example, in section 3.1.2, there are references about h'_\pi obtained from Eq. (3) which is about h_\pi (yes, I understand what the authors mean, but there can be better ways to present that).
(c) I'm not sure if it's correct in Section 3.2.2 h'_z is computed from \mu and \sigma. So how \mu' and \sigma' are being used ?
(d) G+O-AVG should be something like G+O_{AVG}. The minus sign makes it looks like there's an ablation test there. Similarly for other symbols.

The idea seems to be to use a latent variable model and condition it on the image. In practice from Equation 3 and Figure 3 one can see that the image is only used during training to do inference. That said, the approach appears flawed, because the image is not really used for translation.

Experimental results are weak. If the model selection was done properly, that is using the validation set, the considered model would only bring 0.6 METEOR and 0.2 BLEU advantage over the baseline. In the view of the overall variance of the results, these improvements can not be considered significant.

This paper simplify matching network by considering only a single prototype per class which is obtained as the average of the embedding of the training class samples. Empirical comparisons with matching networks are reported.

*** Review ***

The paper reads well and clearly motivate the work. This work of learning metric learning propose to simplify an earlier work (matching network) which is a great objective. However, I am not sure it achieve better results than matching networks. The space of learning embeddings to optimize nearest neighbor classification has been explored before, but the idea of averaging the propotypes is interesting (as a non-linear extension of Mensink et al 2013). I would suggest to improve the discussion of related work and to consolidate the results section to help distinguish between the methods you outperform and the one you do not. 

The related work section can be extended to include work on learning distance metric to optimize a nearest neighbor classification, see Weinberger et al, 2005 and subsequent work. Extensions to perform the same task with neural networks can be found in Min et al, 09 that purse a goal very close to yours. Regarding approaches pursuing similar goals with a different learning objective, you cite siamese network with pairwise supervision. The learning to rank (for websearch) litterature with triplet supervision or global ranking losses is also highly relevant, ie. one example ""the query"" defines the class and the embedding space need to be such that positive/relevant document are closer to the query than the others. I would suggest to start with Chris Burges 2010 tutorial. One learning class 

I am not sure the reported results correctly reflect the state of the art for all tasks. The results are positive on Omniglot but I feel that you should also report the better results of matching networks on miniImageNet with fine tuning and full contextual embeddings. It can be considered misleading not to report it. On Cub 200, I thought that the state-of-the-art was 50.1%, when using features from GoogLeNet (Akata et al 2015), could you comment on this?

Overall, paper could greatly be improved, both in the discussion of related work and with a less partial reporting of prior empirical results.

Instead of using all the examples in the support set during test, the method represents each class by the mean of its learned embeddings. The training procedure and experimental setting are very similar to the original matching networks. I am not completely sure about its advantages over the original matching networks. It seems to me when dealing with 1-shot case, these two methods are identical since there is only one example seen in this class, so the mean of the embedding is the embedding itself. When dealing with 5-shot case, original matching networks compute the weighted average of all examples, but it is at most 5x cost. The experimental results reported for prototypical nets are only slightly better than matching networks. I  think it is a simple, straightforward,  novel extension, but I am not fully convinced its advantages. ",,5.0,3.0

This is combined with episodic few-shot training with randomly-sampled partitions of the training set classes, so that the training and testing scenarios match closely.

Although the idea is quite straightforward, and there are a great many prior works on zero-shot and few-shot learning, the proposed technique is novel to my knowledge, and achieves state-of-the-art results on several  benchmark datasets.

320,False,Non-linear Dimensionality Regularizer for Solving Inverse Problems,"This paper presents an approach to non-linear kernel dimensionality reduction with a trace norm regularizer in the feature space. The authors proposed an iterative minimization approach in order to obtain a local optimum of a relaxed problem. 
The paper contains errors and the experimental evaluation is not convincing. Only old techniques are compared against in very toy datasets. 

The authors claim state-of-the-art, however, the oil dataset is not a real benchmark, and the comparisons are to very old approaches. 
The experimental evaluation should demonstrate robustness to more complex noise and outliers, as this was one of the motivations in the introduction.

The authors do not address the out-of-sample problem. This is a problem of kernel-based methods vs LVMs, and thus should be address here.


The paper contains errors:

- The last paragraph of section 1 says that this paper proposes a closed form solution to robust KPCA. This is simply wrong, as the proposed approach consists of iteratively solving iterativey a set of closed form updates  and Levenberg-Marquard optimizationd. This is not any more closed form!

- In the same paragraph (and later in the text) the authors claim that the proposed approach can be trivially generalized to incorporate other cost functions. This is not true, as in general there will be no more inner loop closed form updates and the authors will need to solve a much more complex optimization problem. 

- The third paragraph of section 2 claims that this paper presents a novel energy minimization framework to solve problems of the general form of eq. (2). However, this is not what the authors solve at the end. They solve a different problem that has been subject to at least two relaxations. It is not clear how solving for a local optima of this double relaxed problem is related to the original problem they want to solve. 

- The paper says that Geiger et al defined non linearities on a latent space of pre-defined dimensionality. This is wrong. This paper discovers the dimensionality of the latent space by means of a regularizer that encourages the singular values to be sparse. Thus, it does not have a fixed dimensionality, the latent space is just bounded to be smaller or equal than the dimensionality of the original space. 


It is not clear to me why the author say for LVMs such as GPLVM that ""the latent space is learned a priority with clean training data"". One can use different noise models within the GP framework. Furthermore, the proposed approach assumes Gaussian noise (see eq. 6), which is also the trivial case for GP-based LVMs.  


It is not clear what the authors mean in the paper by ""pre-training"" or saying that techniques do not have a training phase. KPCA is trained via a closed-form update, but there is still training.",,4.0,4.0
321,False,Non-linear Dimensionality Regularizer for Solving Inverse Problems,"The paper proposes a nonlinear regularizer for solving ill-posed inverse problems. The latent variables (or causal factors) corresponding to the observed data are assumed to lie near a low dimensional subspace in an RKHS induced by a predetermined kernel. The proposed regularizer can be seen as an extension of the linear low-rank assumption on the latent factors. A nuclear norm penalty on the Cholesky factor of the kernel matrix is used as a relaxation for the dimensionality of the subspace. Empirical results are reported on two tasks involving linear inverse problems -- missing feature imputation, and estimating non-rigid 3D structures from a sequence of 2D orthographic projections -- and the proposed method is shown to outperform linear low-rank regularizer. 

The clarity of the paper has scope for improvement (particularly, Introduction) - the back and forth b/w dimensionality reduction techniques and inverse problems is confusing at times. Clearly defining the ill-posed inverse problem first and then motivating the need for a regularizer (which brings dimensionality reduction techniques into the picture) may be a more clear flow in my opinion. 

The motivation behind relaxation of rank() in Eq 1 to nuclear-norm in Eq 2 is not clear to me in this setting. The relaxation does not yield a convex problem over S,C (Eq 5) and also increases the computations (Algo 2 needs to do full SVD of K(S) every time). The authors should discuss pros/cons over the alternate approach that fixes the rank of C (which can be selected using cross-validation, in the same way as $\tau$ is selected), leaving just the first two terms in Eq 5. For this simpler objective, an interesting question to ask would be -- are there kernel functions for which it can solved in a scalable manner? 

The proposed alternating optimization approach in the current form is computationally intensive and seems hard to scale to even moderate sized data -- in every iteration one needs to compute the kernel matrix over S and perform full SVD over the kernel matrix (Algo 2). Empirical evaluations are also not extensive -- (i) the dataset used for feature imputation is old and non-standard, (ii) for structure estimation from motion on CMU dataset, the paper only compares with linear low-rank regularization, (iii) there is no comment/study on the convergence of the alternating procedure (Algo 1).

322,False,Non-linear Dimensionality Regularizer for Solving Inverse Problems,"This paper considers an alternate formulation of Kernel PCA with rank constraints incorporated as a regularization term in the objective. The writing is not clear. The focus keeps shifting from estimating “causal factors”, to nonlinear dimensionality reduction to Kernel PCA to ill-posed inverse problems. The problem reformulation of Kernel PCA uses somewhat standard tricks and it is not clear what are the advantages of the proposed approach over the existing methods as there is no theoretical analysis of the overall approach or empirical comparison with existing state-of-the-art.  

- Not sure what the authors mean by “causal factors”. There is a reference to it in Abstract and in Problem formulation on page 3 without any definition/discussion.

- In KPCA, I am not sure why one is interested in step (iii) outlined on page 2 of finding a pre-image for each

- Authors outline two key disadvantages of the existing KPCA approach. The first one, that of low-dimensional manifold assumption not holding exactly, has received lots of attention in the machine learning literature. It is common to assume that the data lies near a low-dimensional manifold rather than on a low-dimensional manifold. Second disadvantage is somewhat unclear as finding “a data point (pre-image) corresponding to each projection in the input space” is not a standard step in KPCA.

324,True,Training Compressed Fully-Connected Networks with a Density-Diversity Penalty,"The method proposes to compress the weight matrices of deep networks using a new density-diversity penalty together with a computing trick (sorting weights) to make computation affordable and a strategy of tying weights.

This density-diversity penalty consists of an added cost corresponding to the l2-norm of the weights (density) and the l1-norm of all the pairwise differences in a layer.

Regularly, the most frequent value in the weight matrix is set to zero to encourage sparsity.

As weights collapse to the same values with the diversity penalty, they are tied together and then updated using the averaged gradient.

The training process then alternates between training with 1. the density-diversity penalty and untied weights, and 2. training without this penalty but with tied weights.

The experiments on two datasets (MNIST for vision and TIMIT for speech) shows that the method achieves very good compression rates without loss of performance.


The paper is presented very clearly,  presents very interesting ideas and seems to be state of the art for compression. The approach opens many new avenues of research and the strategy of weight-tying may be of great interest outside of the compression domain to learn regularities in data.

325,True,Training Compressed Fully-Connected Networks with a Density-Diversity Penalty,"This work introduces a number of techniques to compress fully-connected neural networks while maintaining similar performance, including a density-diversity penalty and associated training algorithm. The core technique of this paper is to explicitly penalize both the overall magnitude of the weights as well as diversity between weights. This approach results in sparse weight matrices comprised of relatively few unique values. Despite introducing a more efficient means of computing the gradient with respect to the diversity penalty, the authors still find it necessary to apply the penalty with some low probability (1-5%) per mini-batch.

The approach achieves impressive compression of fully connected layers with relatively little loss of accuracy. I wonder if the cost of having to sort weights (even for only 1 or 2 out of 100 mini-batches) might make this method intractable for larger networks. Perhaps the sparsity could help remove some of this cost?

I think the biggest fault this paper has is the number of different things going on in the approach that are not well explored independently. Sparse initialization, weight tying, probabilistic application of density-diversity penalty and setting the mode to 0, and alternating schedule between weight tied standard training and diversity penalty training. The authors don't provide enough discussion of the relative importance of these parts. Furthermore, the only quantitative metric shown is the compression rate which is a function of both sparsity and diversity such that they cannot be compared on their own. I would really like to see how each component of the algorithm affects diversity, sparsity, and overall compression. 

A quick verification: Section 3.1 claims the density-diversity penalty is applied with a fixed probability per batch while 3.4 implies structured phases alternating between application of density-diversity and weight tied standard cross entropy. Is this scheme in 3.4 only applying the density-diversity penalty probabilistically when it is in the density-diversity phase?

Preliminary rating:
I think this is an interesting paper but lacks sufficient empirical evaluation of its many components. As a result, the algorithm has the appearance of a collection of tricks that in the end result in good performance without fully explaining why it is effective.

326,True,Adversarial Feature Learning,"The authors extend GANs by an inference path from the data space to the latent space and a discriminator that operates on the joint latend/data space. They show that the theoretical properties of GANs still hold for BiGAN and evaluate the features learned unsupervised in the inference path with respect to performance on supervised tasks after retraining deeper layers.

I see one structural issue with this paper: Given that, as stated in the abstract, the main purpose of the paper is to learn unsupervised features (and not to improve GANs), the paper might spent too much space on detailing the relationship to GANs and all the theoretical properties. It is not clear whether they actually would help with the goal of learning good features. While reading the paper, I actually totally forgot about the unsupervised features until they reappeared on page 6. I think it would be helpful if the text of the paper would be more aligned with this main story.

Still, the BiGAN framework is an elegant and compelling extension to GANs. However, it is not obvious how much the theoretical properties help us as the model is clearly not fully converged. To me, especially Figure 4 seems to suggest that G(E(x)) might be doing not much more than some kind of nearest neighbour retrival (and indeed one criticism for GANs has always been that they might just memorize some samples). By the way, it would be very interesting to know how well the discriminator actually performs after training.

Coming back to the goal of learning powerful features: The method does not reach state-of-the-art performance on most evaluated tasks (Table 2 and 3) but performs competitive and it would be interesting to see how much this improves if the BiGAN training (and the convolutional architecture used) would be improved.

The paper is very well written and provides most necessary details, although some more details on the training (learning rates, initialization) would be helpful for reproducing the results.

The paper reads well and has sufficent references. The application of adversarial training to text data is a simple but not trivial extension. The experimental section presents extensive experiments with comparison to alternative strategies. The proposed method is simple and effective and can be easily be applied after reading the paper.

*** Detailed Review ***

The paper reads well. I have only a few comments regarding experiments and link to prior resarch:

Experiments:

- In Table 2 (and for other datasets as well), could you include an SVM baseline? e.g. S Wang and C Manning 2012?
- As another baseline, did you consider dropping words, i.e. masking noise? It is generally better than dropout/gaussian noise for text application (e.g. denoising autoencoders)?
- I am not sure I understand why virtual adversarial is worse than the baseline in Table 5. If you tune epsilon, in the worse case you would get the same performance as the baseline? Was it that validation was unreliable?

Related Work:

I think it would be interesting to point at SVM, transductive SVM who achieve something similar to adversarial training. When maximizing the margin in a (transductive) SVM, it is equivalent to move the example toward the decision boundary, i.e. moving them in the direction of increase of the loss gradient.

Also it would be interesting to draw a parallel between adversarial training and contrastive divergence. The adversarial samples are very close in nature to the one step Markov Chain samples from CD. See Bengio 2009. Related to this technique are also approaches that try to explicitely cancel the Jacobian at data points, e.g. Rifai et al 2011.

In terms of novelty on the adversarial side, the authors propose to add perturbations at the level of words embeddings, rather than the input itself (having in mind applications to NLP).

Concerning the experimental section, authors focus on text classification methods. Again, comparison with the existing SVM-related literature is important to assess the viability of the proposed approach; for example (Wang et al, 2012) report 8.8% on IMBD with a very simple linear SVM (without transductive setup).

The first half of the paper, dealing with a single hidden node, was somewhat clear, although I have some specific questions below. The second half, dealing with multiple hidden nodes, was very difficult for me to understand, and the final ""punchline"" is quite unclear. I think the author should focus on intuition and hide detailed derivations and symbols in an appendix. 

In terms of significance, it is very hard for me to be sure how generalizable these results are: the Gaussian assumption is a very strong one, and so is the assumption of iid inputs. Real-world feature inputs are highly correlated and are probably not Gaussian. Such assumptions are not made (as far as I can tell) in recent papers analyzing the convergence of deep networks e.g. Kawaguchi, NIPS 2016. Although the author says the no assumption is made on the independence of activations, this assumption is shifted to the input instead. I think this means that the activations are combinations of iid random variables, and are probably Gaussian like, right? So I'm not sure where this leaves us.

Specific comments:

1. Please use D_w instead of D to show that D is a function of w, and not a constant. This gets particularly confusing when switching to D(w) and D(e) in Section 3. In general, notation in the paper is hard to follow and should be clearly introduced.

2. Section 3, statement that says ""when the neuron is cut off at sample l, then (D^(t))_u"" what is the relationship between l and u? Also, this is another example of notational inconsistency that causes problems to the reader.

3. Section 3.1, what is F(e, w) and why is D(e) introduced? This was unclear to me.

333,False,Symmetry-Breaking Convergence Analysis of Certain Two-layered Neural Networks with ReLU nonlinearity,"The paper proposes a convergence analysis of some two-layer NNs with ReLUs. It is not the first such analysis, but maybe it is novel on the assumptions used in the analysis, and the focus on ReLU nonlinearity that is pretty popular in practice. 

The paper is quite hard to read, with many English mistakes and typos. Nevertheless, the analysis seems to be generally correct. The novelty and the key insights are however not always well motivated or presented. And the argument that the work uses realistic assumptions (Gaussian inputs for example) as opposed to other works, is quite debatable actually. 

Overall, the paper looks like a correct analysis work, but its form is really suboptimal in terms of writing/presentation, and the novelty and relevance of the results are not always very clear, unfortunately. The main results and intuition should be more clearly presented, and details could be moved to appendices for example - that could only help to improve the visibility and impact of these interesting results.

334,False,Symmetry-Breaking Convergence Analysis of Certain Two-layered Neural Networks with ReLU nonlinearity,"This work analyzes the continuous-time dynamics of gradient descent when training two-layer ReLU networks (one input, one output, thus only one layer of ReLU units). The work is interesting in the sense that it does not involve some unrealistic assumptions used by previous works with similar goal. Most importantly, this work does not assume independence between input and activations, and it does not rely on noise injection (which can simplify the analysis). Nonetheless, removing these simplifying assumptions comes at the expense of limiting the analysis to:
1. Only one layer of nonlinear units
2. Discarding the bias term in ReLU while keeping the input Gaussian (thus constant input trick cannot be used to simulate the bias term).
3. Imposing strong assumption on the representation on the input/output via (bias-less) ReLU networks: existence of orthonormal bases to represent this relationships.

Having that said, as far as I can tell, the paper presents original analysis in this new setting, which is interesting and valuable. For example, by exploiting the symmetry in the problem under the assumption 3 I listed above, the authors are able to reduce the high-dimensional dynamics of the gradient descent to a bivariate dynamics (instead of dealing with original size of the parameters). Such reduction to 2D allows the author to rigorously analyze the behavior of the dynamics (e.g. convergence to a saddle point in symmetric case, or to the optimum in non-symmetric case).

Clarification Needed: first paragraph of page 2. Near the end of the paragraph you say ""Initialization can be arbitrarily close to origin"", but at the beginning of the same paragraph you state ""initialized randomly with standard deviation of order 1/sqrt(d)"". Aren't these inconsistent?

Some minor comments about the draft:
1. In section 1, 2nd paragraph: ""We assume x is Gaussian and thus the network is bias free"". Do you mean ""zero-mean"" Gaussian then?
2. ""standard deviation"" is spelled ""standard derivation"" multiple times in the paper.

335,True,Latent Sequence Decompositions,"This submission proposes to learn the word decomposition, or word to sub-word sequence mapping jointly with the attention based sequence-to-sequence model. A particular feature of this approach is that the decomposition is not static, instead, it also conditions on the acoustic input, and the mapping is probabilistic, i.e., one word may map to multiple sub-word sequences. The authors argue that the dynamic decomposition approach can more naturally reflect the acoustic pattern. Interestingly, the motivation behind this approach is analogous to learning the pronunciation mixture model for HMM based speech recognition, where the probabilistic mapping from a word to its pronunciations also conditions on the acoustic input, e.g.,

Overall, the paper is well written, and it is theoretically convincing. The experimental study could be more solid, e.g., it is reasonable to have a word-level baseline, as the proposed approach lies in between the character-level and word-level systems. the vocabulary size of the WSJ si284 dataset is 20K at maximum, which is not very large for the softmax layer, and it is a closed vocabulary task. I guess the word-level system may be also competitive to the numbers reported in this paper. Furthermore, can you explain what is the computational bottleneck of the proposed approach? You downsampled the data by the factor of 4 using an RNN, and it still took around 5 days to converge. To me, it is a bit expensive, especially given that you only take one sample when computing the gradient. Table 2 is a little bit misleading, as CTC with language model and seq2seq with a language model model from Bahdanau et al. is much closer to the best number reported in this Table 2, while you may only get a very small improvement using a language model. Finally, ""O(5) days to converge"" sounds a bit odd to me.",,7.0,5.0

BPE is a very natural (and important) baseline (i.e. dynamic vs fixed decomposition). The BPE performance should be obtained for various BPE vocab sizes. 

Minor points
- Did the learned decompositions correspond to phonetically meaningful units? From the example in the appendix it's hard to tell if the model is learning phonemes or just most frequent character n-grams.
- Any thoughts on applications outside of speech recognition? If this is shown to be effective in other domains it would be a really strong contribution (but this is probably outside the scope for now).

337,True,Latent Sequence Decompositions,"Interesting paper which proposes jointly learning automatic segmentation of words to sub words and their acoustic models.

Although the training handles the word segmentation as hidden variable which depends also on the acoustic representations, during the decoding only maximum approximation is used.

The authors present nice improvements over character based results, however they did not compare results with word segmentation which does not assume the dependency on acoustic.

Obviously, only text based segmentation would result in two (but simpler) independent tasks. In order to extract such segmentation several publicly open tools are available and should be cited. Some of those tools can also exploit the unigram probabilities of the words to perform their segmentations.

It looks that the improvements come from the longer acoustical units - longer acoustical constraints which could lead to less confused search -, pointing towards full word models. In another way, less tokens are more probable due to less multiplication of probabilities. As a thought experiment for an extreme case: if all the possible segmentations would be possible (mixture of all word fragments, characters, and full-words), would the proposed model use word fragments at all? (WSJ is a closed vocabulary task). It would be good to show that the sub word model could outperform even a full-word model (no segmentation).

-- Did the authors simply reformulate the CCA objective or change the objective? The authors need to be explicit here.

-- What is the relationship between the retrieval objective and the ""CCA layer""? I could imagine different ways of combining them, such as combination or bi-level optimization. And I could not find discussion about this in section 3. For this, equations would be helpful.

-- Even though the CCA objective is not differentiable in the above sense, it has not caused major problem for training (e.g., in principle we need batch training, but empirically using large minibatches works fine). The authors need to justify why the original gradient computation is problematic for what the authors are trying to achieve. From the authors' response to my question 2, it seems they still use SVD of T, so I am not sure if the proposed method has advantage in computational efficiency.

In terms of paper organization, it is better to describe the retrieval objective earlier than in the experiments. And I still encourage the authors to conduct the comparison with contrastive loss that I mentioned in my previous comments. ",,4.0,4.0

342,True,"Learning to Query, Reason, and Answer Questions On Ambiguous Texts","This paper investigates a set of tasks that augment the basic bAbI problems. In particular, some of the people and objects in the scenarios are replaced with unknown variables. Some of these variables must be known to solve the question, thus the agent must learn to query for the values of these variables. Interestingly, one can now measure both the performance of the agent in correctly answering the question, and its efficiency in asking for the values of the correct unknown variables (and not variables that are unnecessary to answer the question). This inferring of unknown variables goes beyond what is required for the vanilla version of the bAbI tasks, which are now more or less solved.

The paper is well-written, and the contributions are clear. Due to the very limited vocabulary and structure of the bAbI problems in general, I think these tasks (and variants on them) should be viewed more as basic reasoning tasks than natural language understanding. I’m not convinced by the claim of the paper that this really tests the ‘interaction’ capabilities of agents – while the task is phrased as a kind of interaction, I think it’s more aptly described by simply ‘inferring important unknown variables’, which (while important) is more related to reasoning. I’m not sure whether the connection of this ability to ‘interaction’ is more a superficial one.

That being said, it is certainly true that conversational agents will need basic reasoning abilities to converse meaningfully with humans. I sympathise with the general goal of the bAbI tasks, which is to test these reasoning abilities in synthetic environments, that are just complicated enough (but not more) to drive the construction of interesting models. I am convinced by the authors that their extension to these tasks are interesting and worthy of future investigation, and thus I recommend the acceptance of the paper.

343,True,"Offline bilingual word vectors, orthogonal transformations and the inverted softmax","This paper extends preceding works to create a mapping between the word embedding space of two languages. The word embeddings had been independently trained on monolingual data only, and various forms of bilingual information is used to learn the mapping. This mapping is then used to measure the precision of translations.

In this paper, the authors propose two changes: ""CCA"" and ""inverted softmax"".  Looking at Table 1, CCA is only better than Dina et al in 1 out of 6 cases (It/En @1).  Most of the improvements are in fact obtained by the introduction of the inverted softmax normalization.

 - Faruqui & Dyer 2014 already used CCA and dimensionality reduction
 - Xing et al 2015 argued already that Mikolov's linear matrix should be orthogonal

Using cognates instead of a bilingual directory is a nice trick. Please explain how you obtained this list of cognates ? Obviously, this only works for languages with the same alphabet (for instance Greek and Russian are excluded)

Also, it seems to me that in linguistics the term ""cognate"" refers to words which have a common etymological origin - they don't necessarily have the same written form (e.g. night, nuit, noche, Nacht). Maybe, you should use a different term ? Those words are probably proper names in news texts.",,6.0,3.0

The paper is mostly well executed but somewhat lacks in evaluation. It would have been nice if a stronger downstream task had been attempted.

The inverted Softmax idea is very nice.

A few minor issues that ought to be addressed in a published version of this paper:

1) There is no mention of Haghighi et al (2008) ""Learning Bilingual Lexicons from Monolingual Corpora."", which strikes me as a key piece of prior work regarding the use of CCA in learning bilingual alignment. This paper and links to the work here ought to be discussed.
2) Likewise, Hermann & Blunsom (2013) ""Multilingual distributed representations without word alignment."" is probably the correct paper to cite for learning multilingual word embeddings from multilingual aligned data.
3) It would have been nicer if experiments had been performed with more divergent language pairs rather than just European/Romance languages
4) A lot of the argumentation around the orthogonality requirements feels related to the idea of using a Mahalanobis distance / covar matrix to learn such mappings. This might be worth including in the discussion
5) I don't have a better suggestion, but is there an alternative to using the term ""translation (performance/etc.)"" when discussing word alignment across languages? Translation implies something more complex than this in my mind.

This is a practically useful setting to consider and authors have done a good job of unifying the existing solutions for this problem by providing theoretical justifications.

2. I see that authors have removed precision @5 and @10 from table-6. Is it because of the space constraints or the results have different trend? I would like to see these results in the appendix.
3. In table-6 what is the difference between row-3 and row-4? Is the only difference NN vs. inverted softmax? Or there are other differences? Please elaborate.
4. Another suggestion is to try running an additional experiment where one can use both expert dictionary and cognate dictionary. Comparing all 3 methods in this setting should give more valuable insights about the usefulness of cognate dictionary.

346,False,b-GAN: Unified Framework of Generative Adversarial Networks,"This submission introduces a formulation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) under the lens of density ratio estimation, when using Bregman divergences. Even thought GANs already perform density estimation, the motivation of using Bregman divergences is to obtain an objective function with stronger gradients. I have three concerns with this submission.

First, the exposition of the paper must be significantly improved. The current version of the manuscript is at some points unreadable, and does a poor job at motivating, describing, and justifying the contributions.

Second, the authors scatter a variety of alternatives and heuristics throughout the description of the proposed b-GAN. This introduces a great amount of complexity when it comes to understanding, implementing, and using b-GAN. Further work is necessary to rule out (in a principled manner!) many of the proposed variants of the algorithm.

Third, it is next to impossible to interpret the experimental results, in particular Figures 2, 3, 4. The authors claim that these figures show that ""learning does not stop"", but such behavior can also be attributed to the typical chaotic dynamics of GANs. Even after reading Appendix A, I am left unconvinced on whether the proposed approach provides with any practical advantage (even no comparison is offered to other GAN approaches with similar architectures).

347,False,b-GAN: Unified Framework of Generative Adversarial Networks,"In this paper, the authors extend the f-GAN by using Bregman divergences for density ratio matching. The argument against f-GAN (which is a generalization of the regular GAN) is that the actual objective optimized by the generator during training is different from the theoretically motivated objective due to gradient issues with the theoretically motivated objective. In b-GANS, the discriminator is a density ratio estimator (r(x) = p(x) / q(x)), and the generator tries to minimize the f-divergence between p and q by writing p(x) = r(x)q(x).

My main problem with this paper is that it is unclear why any of this is useful. The connection to density estimation is interesting, but any derived conclusions between the two seem questionable. For example, in previous density estimation literature, the Pearson divergence is more stable. The authors claim that the same holds for GANS and try to show this in their experiments. Unfortunately, the experiments section is very confusing with unilluminating figures. Looking at the graph of density ratios is not particularly illuminating. They claim that for the Pearson divergence and modified KL-divergence, ""the learning did not stop"" by looking at the graph of density ratios. This is completely hand-wavey and no further evidence is given to back this claim. Also, why was the normal GAN objective not tried in light of this analysis? Furthermore, it seems that despite criticizing normal GANs for using a heuristic objective for the generator, multiple heuristics objectives and tricks are used to make b-GAN work.

348,False,b-GAN: Unified Framework of Generative Adversarial Networks,"This paper proposes b-GAN, which trains a discriminator by estimating density ratio that minimizes Bregman divergence.

Note that the unifying view applies only to GAN variants which optimize density ratios. In general, GANs which use MMD in the discriminator step do not fit in the b-GAN framework except for special choices of the kernel. 

I was a bit confused about the dual relationship between f-GAN and b-GAN. Are the conditions on the function f the same in both cases? If so, what's the difference between f-GAN and b-GAN (other than the fact that the former has been derived using f-divergence and the latter has been derived using Bregman divergence)?

One of the original claims was that b-GANs optimize f-divergence directly as opposed to f-GAN and GAN. However, in practice, the authors optimize an approximation to the f-divergence; the quality of the approximation is not quantified anywhere, so b-GAN doesn't seem more principled than f-GAN and GAN.

The experiments left me a bit confused and were not very illuminating on the choice of f.

Congratulations on the acceptance of the paper.

I've just reread parts of the revised paper and noticed a few things that you might want to consider and change before the camera-ready deadline.

* You now include a reference to KLIEP after Eqn. (16), but this procedure is in fact known as least-squares importance estimation.
* in turn, Eqn. (14) is actually more akin to KLIEP, the main difference being the use of the unnormalised form of the KL-divergence. So I think you meant to put the KLIEP reference here.

Further comment on making Eqn. (14) practical:
If you read the KLIEP paper, they formulate the procedure as a constrained optimisation problem:
maximise
$$
E_{p^*} log r_\phi(x)
$$
subject to the constraint that
$$
E_{q_\theta} r_\phi(x) = 1
$$

Compare this constrained optimisation to your solution, it is easy to make the connection: if you introduce a Lagrange multiplier to handle the constraint, one obtains the following unconstrained optimisation problem:

seek stationary points of

$$
\ell(\phi, \lambda) = E_{p^*} log r_\phi(x) - \lambda E_{q_\theta} (r_\phi(x) - 1)
$$

I do think that solving this unconstrained optimisation problem is actually possible, you can do that via stochastic gradient descent, and it does not include your nasty cross-entropy term.

What am I missing?

I think this is an outstanding paper. 
It has greatly helped me towards understanding where failure modes of GANs come from, and I think it will also have great practical implications on how to train GANs. 

Following your ideas, I have played with added noise on GANs. I am able to get the generator to yield 'good looking' samples in much less G iterations than in the standard setting. Also, it appears that 'successful' training is a LOT less sensitive to the setting of hyperparameters. For example I am able to use 10 times higher learning rates, forget about gradient clipping, etc... so this is great! I think this paper paves the way to further research on the following points:
- how to choose noise variance and schedule its decrease over training ?
- what does 'training D to convergence' mean ? In practice it seems that training D 'more than G' but only a few steps is already sufficient. Can we get a theoretical understanding of this...

Also, in my (quick and dirty) first experiments, using instance noise helped training in less G iterations, but the mode dropping problem remained. In my understanding, your theoretical analysis demonstrates that the addition of noise helps D provide gradients to G so that at anytime, G is able to escape its current modes. However, and due to the fact that D outputs are calculated from single examples there is no 'coverage guarantee', for example G could keep switching between different modes. Is this right ? Minibatch discrimination appears to be a good first way to answer this, although not 100% satisfactory because the metric is combinatorial... What is your view on these practical considerations ?

- Section 2.1 Maybe shorten this section a bit. E.g., move all proofs to the appendix. 

- Section 3 provides a nice, intuitive, simple solution. 

- On page 2 second bullet. This also means that P_g is smaller than the data distribution in some other x, which in turn will make the KL divergence non zero. 

- On page 2, ``for not generating plausibly looking pictures'' should be ``for generating not plausibly looking pictures''.

358,True,Towards Principled Methods for Training Generative Adversarial Networks,"This paper makes many valuable contributions and explains many of the issues related to training GANs; I feel it will be an essential platform for future work. However I have the following questions and found the following inconsistencies.

1) 
	“If n <= d, we are done since the image of π is contained in all Rn, a manifold with at 
	most dimension d. We now turn to the case where d > n.”

Is the case  d>n  not contained in the first,  n<=d ? Should this be n>d?

2) The perfect discriminator theorems: 

	“We say that a discriminator D : X → [0, 1] has accuracy 1 if it takes the value 1 on a set that 
	contains the support of P_r  and value 0 on a set that contains the support of P_g .”

If a set S_g or S_r contains the support of P_g or P_r, this suggests that it may contain the support but may also contain regions outside of the support.  Are you suggesting that for x in S_r that are outside the support of P_r, D(x)=1? However, surely regions outside the support of P_r should correspond to generated images, so D(x) should be 0.

b) Following from a), if a set S_g (or S_r) contained regions outside the support (as well as the support) then S_g (or S_r)  would contain the support of P_g (or P_r) but may also contain regions in the support of P_r (or P_g).

3) 
		P_r[D(x) = 1] = 1 and P_g[D(x) = 0] = 1 

a) This notation is not clear, do you mean:
	P_r(x)=1 for all x in {x : D(x)=1} and P_g(x)=1 for all x in {x : D(x)=0}

4) Theorem 2.1

a) It is not clear what distance measure you are using between sets
b) Where does the delta/3 come from? Is this arbitrary?

5) Theorem 2.2
a) What is P^c?
b) Is the ball B(x,e_x) defined for all x in M\L? This is not explicit.

If defined for all x in M\L:
c) For x on the boundary of M\L and P\L is e_x=0? Otherwise, is it possible that for x on the boundary of M\L or P\L , M_hat and P_hat intersect with P\L or M\L respectively? 

Finally:
d) M_hat is a superset of M\L, how can you say D*(x)=1 for all x in M_hat, when M_hat may include regions outside the support of M?

9) Corollary 2.1; 
	""Under the same assumptions of Theorem 1.3 ""
a) What is Theorem 1.3?

11) Theorem 2.5 
a) Could this be explicitly linked to the collapsing generator problem talked about by [1] and [2].  Citations might make the link clearer. 

12) Theorem 2.6 
a) Why do you assume that the distribution of difference between D and D* is white noise? This suggests that most of the time D is optimal, from the rest of the paper this is believable, however if this is what you are assuming, this could be made more explicit. 
b) Similar question for difference in gradient, though since grad D* is zero most of the time, that would suggest that grad D is zero most of the time. Is this true?
c) extra bracket in final line of proof

16) 
       “This is in drastic contrast to the noiseless variants P_g  and P_g,”
a) repeated P_g

17) 
         “again that JSD(P_x,P_{x+e} is maxed out,”
a) missing bracket and inconsistent notation, JSD(P_x||P_{x+e})
b) “maxed out“ is a colloquialism

359,False,Opening the vocabulary of  neural language models with character-level word representations,"In this submission, an interesting approach to character-based language modeling is pursued that retains word-level representations both in the context, and optionally also in the output. However, the approach is not new, cf. (Kim et al. 2015) as cited in the submission, as well as (Jozefowicz et al. 2016). Both Kim and Jozefowicz already go beyond this submission by applying the approach using RNNs/LSTMs. Also, Jozefowicz et al. provide a comparative discussion of different approaches to character-level modeling, which I am missing here, at least by discussing this existing work. THe remaining novelty of the approach then would be its application to machine translation, although it remains somewhat unclear, inhowfar reranking of N-best lists can handle the OOV problem - the translation-related part of the OVV problem should be elaborated here. That said, some of the claims of this submission seems somewhat exaggerated, like the statement in Sec. 2.3: ""making the notion of vocabulary obsolete"", whereas the authors e.g. express doubts concerning the interpretation of perplexity w/o an explicit output vocabulary. For example modeling of especially frequent word forms still can be expected to contribute, as shown in e.g. arXiv:1609.08144

Sec. 2.3: You claim that the objective requires a finite vocabulary. This statement only is correct if the units considered are limited to full word forms. However, using subwords and even individual characters, implicitly larger and even infinite vocabularies can be covered with the log-likelihood criterion. Even though this require a model different from the one proposed here, the corresponding statement should qualified in this respect.

The way character embeddings are used for the output should be clarified. The description in Sec. 2.4 is not explicit enough in my view.

Concerning the configuration of NCE, it would be desirable to get a better idea of how you arrived at your specific configuration and parameterization described in Sec. 3.4.

360,False,Opening the vocabulary of  neural language models with character-level word representations,"This paper proposes an extension of neural network language (NLM) models to better handle large vocabularies. The main idea is to obtain word embeddings by combining character-level embeddings with a convolutional network.

The authors compare word embeddings (WE),character embeddings (CE) as well a combined character and word embeddings (CWE). It's quite obvious how CE or CWE embeddings can be used at the input of an NLM, but this is more tricky at the output layer. The authors propose to use NCE to handle this problem.  NCE allows to speed-up training, but has no impact on inference during testing: the full softmax output layer must be calculated and normalized (which can be very costly).

It was not clear to me how the network is used during TESTING with an open-vocabulary. Since the NLM is only used during reranking, the unnormalized probability of the requested word could be obtained at the output. However, when reranking n-best lists with the NLM feature, different sentences are compared and I wonder whether this does work well without proper normalization.

In addition, the authors provide perplexities in Table 2 and Figures 2 and 3.  This needs normalization, but it is not clear to me how this was performed.  The authors mention a 250k output vocabulary. I doubt that the softmax was calculated over 250k values. Please explain.

The model is evaluated by reranking n-best lists of an SMT systems for the IWSLT 2016 EN/CZ task.  In the abstract, the authors mention a gain of 0.7 BLEU. I do not agree with this claim. A vanilla word-based NLM, i.e. a well-known model, achieves already a gain of 0.6 BLEU. Therefore, the new model proposed in this paper brings only an additional improvement of 0.1 BLEU. This is not statistically significant. I conjecture that a similar variation could be obtained by just training several models with different initializations, etc.

Unfortunately, the NLM models which use a character representation at the output do not work well. There are already several works which use some form of character-level representations at the input.

Could you please discuss the computational complexity during training and inference.

- As an idea, using a meta controller to decide the computational model and the number of steps to reach the conclusion is keeping in line with solving an important practical issue of increased computational times of a simple example. 

- The approach seems similar to an ensemble learning construct. But instead of random experts and a fixed computational complexity during testing time the architecture is designed to estimate hyper-parameters like number of ponder steps which gives this approach a distinct advantage.

365,True,Metacontrol for Adaptive Imagination-Based Optimization,"Pros (quality, clarity, originality, significance:):

This paper presents a novel metacontroller optimization system that learns the best action for a one-shot learning task, but as a framework has the potential for wider application. The metacontroller is a model-free reinforcement learning agent that selects how many optimization iterations and what function or “expert” to consult from a fixed set (such as an action-value or state transition function). Experimental results are presented from simulation experiments where a spacecraft must fire its thruster once to reach a target location, in the presence of between 1 and 5 heavy bodies.

The metacontroller system has a similar performance loss on the one-shot learning task as an iterative (standard) optimization procedure. However, by taking into account the computational complexity of running a classical, iterative optimization procedure as a second “resource loss” term, the metacontroller is shown to be more efficient. Moreover, the metacontroller agent successfully selects the optimal expert to consult, rather than relying on an informed choice by a domain-expert model designer. The experimental performance is a contribution that merits publication, and it also exhibits the use of an interaction network for learning the dynamics of a simulated physical system. The dataset that has been developed for this task also has the potential to act as a new baseline for future work on one-shot physical control systems. The dataset constitutes an ancillary contribution which could positively impact future research in this area.

Cons:
It's not clear how this approach could be applied more broadly to other types of optimization. Moreover, the REINFORCE gradient estimation method is known to suffer from very high variance, yielding poor estimates. I'm curious what methods were used to ameliorate these problems and if any other performance tricks were necessary to train well. Content of this type this could form a useful additional appendix.

A few critiques on the communication of results:

- The formal explication of the paper’s content is clear, but Fig.’s 1A and 3 could be improved. Fig. 1A is missing a clear visual demarcation of what exactly the metacontroller agent is. Have you considered a plate or bounding box around the corresponding components? This would likely speed the uptake of the formal description.

- Fig. 3 is generally clear, but the lack of x-axis tick marks on any subplots makes it more challenging than necessary to compare among the experts. Also, the overlap among the points and confidence intervals in the upper-left subplot interferes with the quantitative meaning of those symbols. Perhaps thinner bars of different colors would help here. Moreover, this figure lacks a legend and so the different lines are impossible to compare with each other.

- Lastly, the second sentence in Appendix B. 2 is a typo and terminates without completion.",,8.0,3.0
366,True,Metacontrol for Adaptive Imagination-Based Optimization,"This paper introduces an approach to reinforcement learning and control wherein, rather than training a single controller to perform a task, a metacontroller with access to a base-level controller and a number of accessory « experts » is utilized. The job of the metacontroller is to decide how many times to call the controller and the experts, and which expert to invoke at which iteration. (The controller is a bit special in that in addition to being provided the current state, it is given a summary of the history of previous calls to itself and previous experts.) The sequence of controls and expert advice is embedded into a fixed-size vector through an LSTM. The method is tested on an N-body  control task, where it is shown that there are benefits to multiple iterations (« pondering ») even for simple experts, and that the metacontroller can deliver accuracy and computational cost benefits over fixed-iteration controls.

The paper is in general well written, and reasonably easy to follow. As the authors note, the topic of metareasoning has been studied to some extent in AI, but its use as a differentiable and fully trainable component within an RL system appears new. At this stage, it is difficult to evaluate the impact of this kind of approach: the overall model architecture is intriguing and probably merits publication, but whether and how this will scale to other domains remains the subject of future work. The experimental validation is interesting and well carried out, but remains of limited scope. Moreover, given such a complex architecture, there should be a discussion of the training difficulties and convergence issues, if any.

Here are a few specific comments, questions and suggestions:

1) in Figure 1A, the meaning of the graphical language should be explained. For instance, there are arrows of different thickness and line style — do these mean different things? 

2) in Figure 3, the caption should better explain the contents of the figure. For example, what do the colours of the different lines refer to? Also, in the top row, there are dots and error bars that are given, but this is explained only in the « bottom row » part. This makes understanding this figure difficult.

3) in Figure 4, the shaded area represents a 95% confidence interval on the regression line; in addition, it would be helpful to give a standard error on the regression slope (to verify that it excludes zero, i.e. the slope is significant), as well as a fraction of explained variance (R^2). 

4) in Figure 5, the fraction of samples using the MLP expert does not appear to decrease monotonically with the increasing cost of the MLP expert (i.e. the bottom left part of the right plot, with a few red-shaded boxes). Why is that? Is there lots of variance in these fractions from experiment to experiment?

* The authors propose a formalism for dealing with compositions of different kinds of invariance.

Cons:
* For me the explanation of the generalization is really hard to follow. For me, the paper would be stronger if were less broad, but went into more depth for the permutation-invariance case.
* It is very easy to sit down and come up with network structures that are permutation invariant. It seems the author tried a few networks in the family (a few different point cloud sizes, a couple options for the number of parameters, averaging vs. max in the set, dropout vs. no dropout), but unless the space is more completely and systematically explored, there's not much reason for a practitioner to use the proposed structure vs. some other random structure they cook up that is also permutation invariant. i.e. what about just using a FC layer that is shared between the points instead of your three ""set invariant"" layers? Seems simpler, more general, and also permutation invariant...
* It is not clear to me how valuable the author's definition of ""minimally invariant"" is. Is a sufficiently large composition of ""set invariant"" layers a universal approximator for permutation invariant functions?
* I'm concerned that proposed ""set invariant layer"" might be strongly variant to spatial transformations, as well as vulnerable to large outliers. In particular there is a term that subtracts a corner of the clouds bounding box (i.e. the max over set operator inside the first layer), before the cloud goes through a learned affine transform and pixelwise nonlinearity.

This paper discusses ways to enforce invariance in neural networks using weight sharing.  The authors formalize a way for feature functions to be invariant to a collection of relations and the main invariance studied is a “set-invariant” function, which is used in an anomaly detection setting and a point cloud classification problem.  

“Invariance” is, at a high level, an important issue of course, since we don’t want to spend parameters to model spurious ordering relationships, which may potentially be quite wasteful and I like the formalization of invariance presented in this paper.  However, there are a few weaknesses that I feel prevent this from being a strong submission.  First, the exposition is too abstract and this paper could really use a running and *concrete* example starting from the very beginning.

Second, “set invariance”, which is the main type of invariance studied in the paper is defined via the author’s formalization of invariance, but is never explicitly related to what I might think of as “set invariance” — e.g. to permutations of input or output dimensions.  Explicitly defining set invariance in some other way, then relating it to the  “structural invariance” formulation may be a better way to explain things.  It is never made clear, for example, why Figure 1(b) is *the* set data-structure.

I like the discussion of compositionality of structures (one question I have here is: are the resulting compositional structures are still valid as structures?).  But the authors have ignored the other kind of compositionality that is important to neural networks — specifically that relating the proposed notion of invariance to function composition seems important — i.e. under what conditions do compositions of invariant functions remain invariant?  And  It is clear to me that just by having one layer of invariance in a network doesn’t make the entire network invariant, for example.  So if we look at the anomaly detection network at the end for example, is it clear that the final predictor is “set invariant” in some sense?  

Regarding experiments, there are no baselines presented for anomaly detection.  Baselines *are* presented in the point cloud classification problem, but the results of the proposed model are not the best, and this should be addressed.  (I should say that I don’t know enough about the dataset to say whether these are exactly fair comparisons or not).  It is also never really made clear why set invariance is a desirable property for a point cloud classification setting.  As a suggestion: try a network that uses a fully connected layer at the end, but uses data augmentation to enforce set invariance.  Also, what about classical set kernels?

Other random things:
* Example 2.2: Shouldn’t |S|=5 in the case of left-right and up-down symmetry?
* “Parameters shared within a relation” is vague and undefined.
* Why is “set convolution” called “set convolution” in the appendix?  What is convolutional about it?
* Is there a relationship to symmetric function theory?

376,True,Topology and Geometry of Half-Rectified Network Optimization,"This work contributes to understanding the landscape of deep networks in terms of its topology and geometry. The paper analyzes the former theoretically, and studies the latter empirically. Although the provided contributions are very specific (ReLU nets with single hidden layer, and a heuristic to calculate the normalized geodesic), the results are original and of interest. Thus, they could potentially be used as stepping stones for deeper developments in this area.

Pros:
1. Providing new theory about existence of ""poor"" local minima for ReLU networks with a hidden unit that relies on input distribution properties as well as the size of the hidden layer.

The results are very specific in both topology and geometry analysis.
1. The analysis is performed only over a ""single"" hidden layer ReLU network. Given the importance of depth in deep architectures, this result cannot really explain the kinds of architectures we are interested in practically. 
2. The normalized geodesic criterion is somewhat limited in representing how easy it is to connect two equally good points. For example, there might exist a straight line between the two (which is considered as easy by the geodesic criterion), but this line might be going through a very narrow valley, challenging gradient based optimization algorithms (and thus extremely difficult to navigate in practice). In addition, the proposed algorithm for computing the normalized geodesic is a greedy heuristic, which as far as I can tell, makes it difficult to know how we can trust in the estimated geodesics obtained by this algorithm.

It is generally clearly written and nicely provides intuitions for the results.  One main contribution is to show that the level sets of the loss becomes connected as the network is increasingly overparameterized.  It also quantifies, in a way, the degree of disconnectedness possible in terms of the increase in loss that one must allow to find a connected path.  It would seem that this might have some implications for the likelihood of escaping local minima with stochastic gradient descent.  The paper also presents a simple algorithm for finding geodesic paths between two networks such that the loss is decreasing along the path.  Using this they show that the loss seems to become more nonconvex when the loss is smaller.  This is also quite interesting.

The work does have some significant limitations, which is not surprising given the difficulty of fully analyzing the network loss function.  However, the authors are quite clear about these limitations, which especially include not yet analyzing deep networks and analyzing only the oracle loss, and not the empirical loss.  I would have also appreciated a little more practical discussion of the bound in Theorem 2.4.  It is hard to tell whether this bound is tight enough to be practically relevant.

I find the paper very unclear. I tried to find a proper definition of the joint model p(x,z) but could not extract this from the text. The proposed “EM-like” algorithm should then also follow directly from this definition. At this point I do not see if such as definition even exists. In other words, is there is an objective function on which the iterates of the proposed algorithm are guaranteed to improve on the train data?

The paper jumps in with no motivation at all. What is the application, or even the algorithm, or architecture that this is used for? This should be addressed at the beginning.

The subsequent exposition is not very clear. There are assertions made with no justification, e.g. “the experts only have a small variance for some subset of the variables while the variance of the other variables is large.” 

Since you’re learning both the experts and the weights, can this be rephrased in terms of dictionary learning? Please discuss the relevant related literature.

As mentioned also by others more insights from the experiments would have been great.

The proposed approach is based on the use of an LSTM encoding of dialogue context, reference response and model response with appropriate scoring, with the essence of training one dialogue model to evaluate another model. However, the proposed solution depends on a reasonably good dialogue model to begin with, which is not guaranteed, rendering the new metric possibly meaningless. ",,5.0,4.0
384,False,Towards an automatic Turing test: Learning to evaluate dialogue responses,"This paper propose a new evaluation metric for dialogue systems, and show it has a higher correlation with human annotation. I agree the MT based metrics like BLEU are too simple to capture enough semantic information, but the metric proposed in this paper seems to be too compliciated to explain.

On the other hand, we could also use equation 1 as a retrieval based dialogue system. So what is suggested in this paper is basically to train one dialogue model to evaluate another model. Then, the high-level question is why we should trust this model? This question is also relevant to the last item of my detail comments.

Detail comments:

- How to justify what is captured/evaluated by this metric? In terms of BLEU, we know it actually capture n-gram overlap. But for this model, I guess it is hard to say what is captured. If this is true, then it is also difficult to answer the question like: will the data dependence be a problem?
- why not build model incrementally? As shown in equation (1), this metric uses both context and reference to compute a score. Is it possible to show the score function using only reference? It will guarantee this metric use the same information source as BLEU or ROUGE. 
- Another question about equation (1), is it possible to design the metric to be a nonlinear function. Since from what I can tell, the comparison between BLEU (or ROUGE) and the new metric in Figure 3 is much like a comparison between the exponential scale and the linear scale.
- I found the two reasons in section 5.2 are not convincing if we put them together. Based on these two reasons, I would like to see the correlation with average score. A more reasonable way is to show the results both with and without averaging. 
- In table 6, it looks like the metric favors the short responses. If that is true, this metric basically does the opposite of BLEU, since BLEU will panelize short sentences. On the other hand, human annotators also tends to give short respones high scores, since long sentences will have a higher chance to contain some irrelevant words.

385,True,Learning through Dialogue Interactions by Asking Questions,"This paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks for evaluating a dialogue agent's ability to learn from user feedback. For solving these tasks, the paper uses memory networks (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) learned through previously proposed supervised learning and reinforcement learning methods. In this setup, it is demonstrated that the agent learning from feedback (e.g. through question asking or question clarification) performs better.

The motivation for the paper is excellent; dialogue agents which learn directly from unstructured human feedback (as opposed to reward signals alone) could be very useful in real-world applications. However, the paper falls short on the execution. All the numerous experiments presented are based on the synthetic dialogue simulator, which is highly artificial and different from real-world dialogues. The simulator is based on a simple factoid question-answering framework, which normally is not considered dialogue and which appears to be solvable with a few hand-crafted rules. The framework also assumes that the user's feedback is always correct and is given in one of a handful of forms (e.g. paraphrase of original question without typos) and that the agent can learn from examples of another agent asking questions or making clarifications, which simplifies the task even further.

Because of the artificial setting and limited scope of the experiments, it seems difficult to draw conclusions about how to learn from unstructured user feedback. To test the hypothesis that it is possible to learn from such user feedback, I would strongly recommend the authors to continue working on this project by carrying out experiments with real human users (even in the factoid question answering domain, if necessary). This would provide much stronger evidence that a dialogue agent can learn from such feedback.


Other comments:
- The abstract uses the phrase ""interactive dialogue agents"". What is meant by ""interactive"" dialogue agents? All dialogue agents interact with the user, so isn't it redundant to call them interactive?
- A major limitation of the experiments is that the questions the agent can ask are specified a priori. If I understand correctly, in the supervised learning setting the agent is trained to imitate the questions of another rule-based agent. While in the RL setting, the paper states ""For each dialogue, the bot takes two sequential actions $(a_1 , a_2)$: to ask or not to ask a question (denoted as a_1 ); and guessing the final answer (denoted as a_2)"". This means the agent learns *when* to ask questions but not *what* questions to ask.
- Related to the previous comment, in the sub-section ""ONLINE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (RL)"" the paper states ""We also explored scenarios where the student learns the ability to decide when to ask a question and what to ask."". Please clarify this by removing the part ""what to ask"".
- The paper presents an overwhelming amount of results. I understand the benefit of synthetic tasks is precisely the ability to measure many aspects of model performance, but in this case it confuses the reader to present so many results. For example, what was the reason for including the ""TrainAQ(+FP)"" and ""TrainMix"" training settings? How do these results help validate the original hypothesis? If they don't, they should be taken out or moved to the appendix.
- Since the contribution of the paper lies in the tasks and evaluation, it might be better to move either the vanilla-MemN2N (Table 2) to the appendix or to move the Cont-MemN2N results (Table 3) to the appendix.

The paper introduces a simulator and a set of synthetic question answering tasks where interaction with the ""teacher"" via asking questions is desired. The motivation is that an intelligent agent can improve its performance by asking questions and getting corresponding feedback from users. The paper studies this problem in an offline supervised and an online reinforcement learning settings. The results show that the models improve by asking questions.  

-- The idea is novel, and is relatively unexplored in the research community. The paper serves as a good first step in that direction.
-- The paper studies three different types of tasks where the agent can benefit from user feedback.
-- The paper is well written and provides a clear and detailed description of the tasks, models and experimental settings.

Other comments/questions: 
-- What is the motivation behind using both vanilla-MemN2N AND Cont-MemN2N? Is using both resulting in any conclusions which are adding to the paper's contributions?
-- In the Question Clarification setting, what is the distribution of misspelled words over question entity, answer entity, relation entity or none of these? If most of the misspelled words come from relation entities, it might be a much easier problem than it seems.
-- The first point on Page 10 ""The performance of TestModelAQ is worse than TestAQ but better than TestQA."" is not true for Task 2 from the numbers in Tables 2 and 4.
-- What happens if the conversational history is smaller or none? 
-- Figure 5, Task 6, why does the accuracy for good student drop when it stops asking questions? It already knows the relevant facts, so asking questions is not providing any additional information to the good student. 
-- Figure 5, Task 2, the poor student is able to achieve almost 70% of the questions correct even without asking questions. I would expect this number to be quite low. Any explanation behind this?

387,True,Learning through Dialogue Interactions by Asking Questions,"The goal of this paper is to analyze the behaviour of dialogue agents when they must answer factoid questions, but must query an oracle for additional information. This can be interpreted as a form of interaction between the dialogue agent and a ‘teacher’.

The problem under investigation is indeed very important. The authors create a synthetic environment in which to test their agent. The main strength of the paper is that the paper tests many different combinations of environments, where either some knowledge is missing (and the agent has to query for it), or there is some misspelling in the teacher’s question, and different ways the agent can ask for extra information. 

I am a bit concerned that many of the tasks are too easy (e.g. the AQ question paraphrase), and I am also concerned that the environment presented is very limited, and quite far (in terms of richness of linguistic structure) from how real humans would interact with chatbots. I think the paper would be better positioned as testing the basic reasoning capabilities of agents/ their ability to do question answering, rather than dialogue. However, I think the ‘ground-up’ approach that starts with simple environments is indeed worthy of analysis, and this paper makes an interesting contribution in that direction. Of course, the paper would be much more convincing with human experiments. 

Additional notes:
I think the simulation, in the synthetic environment, for the first mistake a learner can make during dialogue: “the learner has problems understanding the surface form of the text of the dialogue partner, e.g., the phrasing of a question”, is particularly limited since only word misspellings are considered (and the models used don’t work at the character level), which is of course only a tiny fraction of ways an agent can misunderstand the context. I would be particularly interested to see some discussion of how the authors plan to scale this up to more realistic settings.

The resulting ""summary"" is used to condition a generative model (a VAE) that produces new samples of the same kind as the exemplars shown. The proposed aggregation and conditioning procedure are better suited to sets of exemplars that come from several classes than simple averaging.
Perhaps surprisingly the model generalizes from generation conditioned on samples from 2 classes to generation conditioned on samples from 4 classes.

389,False,Fast Adaptation in Generative Models with Generative Matching Networks,"This paper proposes an interesting idea for rapidly adapting generative models in the low data regime. The idea is to use similar techniques that are used in one-shot learning, specifically ideas from matching networks. To that end, the authors propose the generative matching networks model, which is effectively a variational auto-encoder that can be conditioned on an input dataset. Given a query point, the model matches the query point to points in the conditioning set using an attention model in an embedding space (this is similar to matching networks). The results on the Omniglot dataset show that this method is successfully able to rapidly adapt to new input distributions given few examples.

I think that the method is very interesting, however the major issue for me with this paper is a lack of clarity. I outline more details below, but overall I found the paper somewhat difficult to follow. There are a lot of details that I feel are scattered throughout, and I did not get a sense after reading this paper that I would be able to implement the method and replicate the results. My suggestion is to consolidate the major implementation details into a single section, and be explicit about the functional form of the different embedding functions and their variants.

I was a bit disappointed to see that weak supervision in the form of labels had to be used. How does the method perform in a completely unsupervised setting? This could be an interesting baseline.

There is a lack of definition of the different functions. Some basic insight into the functional forms of f, g, \phi, sim and R would be nice. Otherwise it is very unclear to me what’s going on.

Section 3.2: “only state of the recurrent controller was used for matching”, my reading of this section (after several passes) is that the pseudo-input is used in the place of a regular input. Is this correct? Otherwise, this sentence/section needs more clarification. I noticed upon further reading in section 4.2 that there are two versions of the model: one in which a pseudo input is used, and one in which a pseudo input is not used (the conditional version). What is the difference in functional form between these? That is, how do the formulas for the embeddings f and g change between these settings?

“since the result was fully contrastive we did not apply any further binarization” what does it mean for a result to be fully contrastive?

For clarity, the figures and table refer to the number of shots, but this is never defined. I assume this is T here. This should be made consistent.

Figure 2: why is the value of T only 9 in this case? What does it mean for it to be 0? It is stated earlier that T should go up to 20 (I assume #shot corresponds to T). It also looks like the results continue to improve with an increased number of steps, I would like to see the results for 5 and maybe 6 steps as well. Presumably there will come a point where you get diminishing returns.

Table 1: is the VAE a fair baseline? You mention that Ctest affects Pd() in the evaluation. The fact that the VAE does not have an associated Ctest implies that the two models are being evaluated with a different metric. Can the authors clarify this? It’s important that the comparison is apples-to-apples.

MNIST is much more common than Omniglot for evaluating generative models. Would it be possible to perform similar experiments on this dataset? That way it can be compared with many more models.

Further, why are the negative log-likelihood values monotonically decreasing in the number of shots? That is, is there ever a case where increasing the number of shots can hurt things? What happens at T=30? 40?

As a minor grammatical issue, the paper is missing determiners in several sentences. At one point, the model is referred to as “she” instead of “it”. “On figure 3” should be changed to “in figure 3” in the experiments section.

Strengths:
1. The paper shows performance improvements over existing solutions

Weaknesses:
1. The paper is very incremental.
2. The paper is addressed to a very narrow audience. The paper very clearly assumes that the reader is familiar with the previous work on the ternary quantization. It is ""what is new in the topic"" update, not really a standalone paper.

What is presented is an engineering gimmick, that would be cool and valuable if it really is used in production, but is that really needed for anything? Are there any practical applications that require this refinement? I do not find the motivation ""it is related to mobile, therefore it is cool"" sufficient.

Unlike past work, these quantized values are separate and learned stochastically alongside all other network parameters. This approach achieves impressive quantization results while retaining or surpassing corresponding full-precision networks on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.

Strengths:

- Overall well written and algorithm is presented clearly.
- Approach appears to work well in the experiments, resulting in good compression without loss (and sometimes gain!) of performance.
- I enjoyed the analysis of sparsity (and how it changes) over the course of training, though it is uncertain if any useful conclusion can be drawn from it.

Some points:

- The energy analysis in Table 3 assumes dense activations due to the unpredictability of sparse activations. Can the authors provide average activation sparsity for each network to help verify this assumption. Even if the assumption does not hold, relatively close values for average activation between the networks would make the comparison more convincing.

- In section 5.1.1, the authors suggest having a fixed t (threshold parameter set at 0.05) for all layers allows for varying sparsity (owed to the relative magnitude of different layer weights with respect to the maximum). In Section 5.1.2 paragraph 2, this is further developed by suggesting additional sparsity can be achieved by allowing each layer a different values of t. How are these values set? Does this multiple threshold style network appear in any of the tables or figures? Can it be added?

- The authors claim ""ii) Quantized weights play the role of ""learning rate multipliers"" during back propagation."" as a benefit of using trained quantization factors. Why is this a benefit? 

- Figure and table captions are not very descriptive.

393,True,Trained Ternary Quantization,"This paper presents a ternary quantization method for convolutional neural networks. All weights are represented by ternary values multiplied by two scaling coefficients. Both ternary weights and the scaling coefficients are updated using back-propagation. This is useful for CNN model compression. Experiments on AlexNet show that the proposed method is superior Ternary-Weight-Networks (TWN) and DoReFa-Net. This work has the following strengths and weaknesses.

Strengths:
(1). Good results are shown on CIFAR-10 dataset.

(2). Massive energy saving of the ternary weights comparing to 32-bit weights.

(3). It is well written, and easy to understand.

Weaknesses:

(1). It seems that this work is an incremental improvement on the existing works. The main difference from Binary-Weight-Networks (BWN) proposed in XNOR-net[1] is using ternary weights instead of binary weights, while ternary weights have been used by many previous works. Both BWN and the proposed method in this paper learn the scaling factors during training. Comparing to Ternary-Weight-Networks (TWN), the main difference is that two independent quantization factors are used for positive and negative weights, while TWN utilizes the same scaling factor for all weights. 

(2). In the experiment, the authors did not process the first conv layer and the last fully-connected layer. The results of processing all layers should be given for fair comparison. 

(3). In the experiment, comparison with BWN is not reported. In [1], the top-1 and top-5 error of AlexNet on ImageNet of BWN is 43.2% and 20.6%, which is comparable with the method proposed in this paper (42.5% and 20.3%). However, the BWN only uses binary weights and all layers are binarized including the first conv layer and the last fully-connected layer. 

(4). For the baseline method of full precision alexnet (with BN), the reported accuracy seems to be too low (44.1% top-1 error). Commonly, using batch normalization can boost the accuracy, while the reported accuracy are much lower than alexnet without batch normalization. On the other hand, the error rates of pre-trained model of alexnet (with BN) reported by the official MatConvNet [2] are 41.8% and 19.2%. 

(5). The proposed method should be evaluated on the original AlexNet, whose accuracy is publicly available for almost all deep learning frameworks like caffe. Moreover, more experiments should be added on ImageNet, like VGG-S, VGG-16, GoogleNet or ResNet.

(6). In previous methods such as XNOR-net and TWN, most of the 32-bit multiply operation can be replaced by addition by using binary or ternary weights. However, the proposed method in this paper utilizes independent scaling factors for positive and negative weights. Thus it seems that the multiply operation can not be replaced by addition.

395,False,Exploring the Application of Deep Learning for Supervised Learning Problems,"This paper presents an intriguing study of how one can pose architecture search as a meta learning problem. By collecting features from networks trained on various datasets and training a “ranking classifier” (the actual details of the classifier do not seem to be described in detail) one can potentially infer what a good architecture for a new problem could be by simply running the ranker on the extracted features for a new problem setup.

One notable comment from the paper is that the authors fix some important hyper-parameters for all the networks. I am of the opinion that optimizing the learning rate (and its decay schedule) is actually quite important. I hypothesize that a lot of the conclusions of this paper may change quite a bit if the authors did an actual search over the rates instead. I suspect that instead of training 11k nets, one can train 2k nets with 5 learning rates each and get a much better result that is actually compelling.

I am not convinced that the protocol for generating the various architectures is doing a good job at creating a diversity of architecture (simply because of the max depth of 8 layers and 14 components overall). I suspect that most of these generated architectures are actually almost identical performance-wise and that it’s a waste to train so many of them on so many tasks. Unless the authors are already doing this, they should define a pruning mechanism that filters out nets that are too similar to already existing ones.

The batch normalization experiments in Table 2 seem odd and under-explained. It is also well-known that the optimal learning rates when using batch norm vs. not using batch norm can differ by an order of magnitude so given the fixed learning rate throughout all experiments, I take these results with some grain of salt.

I am not sure we got many insights into the kinds of architectures that ended up being at the top. Either visualizations, or trends (or both), would be great.

This work seems to conflate the study of parallel vs. serial architectures with the study of meta learning, which are somewhat distinct issues. I take issue with the table that compares parallel vs. serial performance (table 2) simply because the right way would be to filter the architectures by the same number of parameters / capacity.

Ultimately the conclusion seems to be that when applying deep nets in a new domain, it is difficult to come up with a good architecture in advance. In that sense, it is hard to see the paper as a constructive result, because it’s conclusions are that while the ranker may do a good job often-times, it’s not that reliable.

397,False,Exploring the Application of Deep Learning for Supervised Learning Problems,"This paper aims at attacking the problem of preselecting deep learning model structures for new domains. It reported a series of experiments on various small tasks and feed-forward DNNs. It claims that some ranking algorithm can be learned based on these results to guide the selection of model structures for new domains.

Although the goal is interesting I found their conclusion is neither convincing nor useful in practice for several reasons:

1. They only explored really simple networks (feed-forward DNNs). While this significantly limited the search space, it also limited the value of the experiments. In fact, the best model architecture is highly task (domain) dependent and the type of model (DNN vs CNN vs LSTM) is often much more important than size of the network itself.
2. Their experiments were conduced with some important hyper parameters (e.g., learning rate schedule) fixed. However, it is well known  that learning rate often is the most important hyper parameter during training. Without adjusting these important hyper parameters the conclusion on the best model architecture is not convincing.
3. Their experiments seem to indicate that the training data difference is not important. However, this is unlikely to be true as you would definitely want to use larger models (total number of parameters) when your training set is magnitude larger (i.e., log(datasize) can be an important feature). This is likely because they did not run experiments on large datasets.

1. As the authors point out, the AUROC/AUPR criterion is threshold independent. As a result, it is not obvious whether the thresholds that would correspond to a certain operating point (say a true positive rate of 10%) would be similar across different data sets. In other words, it would be interesting to know how sensitive the thresholds are to different test sets (or different splits of the test set). This is important if we want to use the thresholds determined on a given held-out set during evaluation on unseen data (where we would need to select a threshold).

2. Performance is reported in terms of AUROC/AUPR and models are compared against a random baseline. I think it’s a little hard to look at the differences in AUC/AUPR to get a sense for how much better the proposed classifier is than the random baseline. It would be useful, for example, if the authors could also report how strongly statistically significant some of these differences are (although admittedly they look to be pretty large in most cases).

3. In the experiments on speech recognition presented in Section 3.3, I was not entirely clear on how the model was evaluated. In Table 9, for example, is an “example” the entire utterance or just a single (stacked?) speech frame. Assuming that each “example” is an utterance, are the softmax probabilities the probability of the entire phone sequence (obtained by multiplying the local probability estimates from a Viterbi decoding?)

4. I’m curious about the decision to ignore the blank symbol’s logit in Section 3.3. Why is this required?

5. As I mentioned in the pre-review question, at least in the speech recognition case, it would have been interesting to compare performance obtained using a simple generative baseline (e.g., GMM-HMM). I think that would serve as a good indication of the ability of the proposed model to detect out-of-domain examples over the baseline.",,6.0,3.0

400,True,A Baseline for Detecting Misclassified and Out-of-Distribution Examples in Neural Networks,"The authors propose the use of statistics of softmax outputs to estimate the probability of error and probability of a test sample being out-of-domain. They contrast the performance of the proposed method with directly using the softmax output probabilities, and not their statistics, as a measure of confidence.

It would be great if the authors elaborate on the idea of ignoring the logit of the blank symbol.

It would be interesting to see the performance of the proposed methods in more confusable settings, ie., in cases where the out-of-domain examples are more similar to the in-domain examples. e.g., in the case of speech recognition this might correspond to using a different language's speech with an ASR system trained in a particular language. Here the acoustic characteristics of the speech signals from two different languages might be more similar as compared to the noisy and clean speech signals from the same language.

In section 4, the description of the auxiliary decoder setup might benefit from more detail.

401,False,Memory-augmented Attention Modelling for Videos,"This paper addresses video captioning with a TEM-HAM architecture, where a HAM module attends over attended outputs of the TEM module when generating the description. This gives a kind of 2-level attention. The model is evaluated on the Charades and MSVD datasets.

1. Quality/Clarify: I found this paper to be poorly written and relatively hard to understand. As far as I can tell the TEM module of Section 3.1 is a straight-forward attention frame encoder of Bahdanau et al. 2015 or Xu et al. 2015. The decoder of Section 3.3 is a standard LSTM with log likelihood. The HAM module of Section 3.2 is the novel module but is not very well described. It looks to be an attention LSTM where the attention is over the TEM LSTM outputs, but the attention weights are additionally conditioned on the decoder state. There are a lot of small problems with the description, such as notational discrepancy in using \textbf in equations and then not using it in the text. Also, I spent a long time trying to understand what f_m is. The authors say: 

""In order to let the network remember what has been attended before and the temporal
structure of a video, we propose f_m to memorize the previous attention and encoded version of an
input video with language model. Using f_m not only enables the network to memorize previous
attention and frames, but also to learn multi-layer attention over an input video and corresponding
language.""

Where one f_m is bold and the other f_m is not. Due to words such as ""we propose f_m"" assumed this was some kind of a novel technical contribution I couldn't find any details about but it is specified later in Section 3.3 at the end that f_m is in fact just an LSTM. It's not clear why this piece of information is in Section 3.3, which discusses the decoder. The paper is sloppy in other parts. For example in Table 1 some numbers have 1 significant digit and some have 2. The semantics of the horizontal line in Table 2 are not explained in text. 

2. Experimental results: The ablation study shows mixed results when adding TEM and HAM to the model. Looking at METEOR which was shown to have the highest correlation to humans in the COCO paper compared to the other evaluation criteria, adding TEM+HAM improves the model from 31.20 to 31.70. It is not clear how significant this improvement is, especially given that the test set is only 670 videos. I have doubts over this result. In Table 2, the METEOR score of Pan et al. 2016a is higher [33.10 vs. 31.80], but this discrepancy is not addressed in text. This is surprising because the authors explicitly claim ""state of the art results"".

3. Originality/Significance: The paper introduces an additional layer of attention over a more standard sequence to sequence setup, which is argued to alleviate the burden on the LSTM's memory. This is moderately novel but I don't believe that the experimental results make it sufficiently clear that it is also worth doing. If the paper made the standard model somehow simpler instead of more complex I would be more inclined to judge it favorably.


Minor:
In response to the author's comment ""not sure what causes to think of RBM. We don't model any part of our architecture using RBM. We'd be appreciated if you please elaborate more about your confusion about figure 1 so we can address it accordingly."", I created a diagram to hopefully make this more clear:",,4.0,
402,False,Memory-augmented Attention Modelling for Videos,"The authors propose a ""hierarchical"" attention model for video captioning.  They introduce a model composed of three parts: the temporal modeler (TEM) that takes as input the video sequence and outputs a sequential representation of the video to the HAM; the hierarchical attention/memory mechanism (HAM) implements a soft-attention mechanism over the sequential video representation; and finally a decoder that generates a caption. 

Related to the second series of questions above, it seems as though the authors have chosen to refer to their use of an LSTM (or equivalent RNN) as the output of the Bahdanau et al (2015) attention mechanism as a hierarchical memory mechanism. I am actually sympathetic to this terminology in the sense that the recent popularity of memory-based models seems to neglect the memory implicit in the LSTM state vector, but that said, this seems to seriously misrepresent the significance fo the contribution of this paper. 

I appreciate the ablation study presented in Table 1. Not enough researchers bother with this kind of analysis. But it does show that the value of the contributions is not actually clear. In particular the case for the TEM is quite weak.

Regarding the quantitative evaluation presented in Table 2, the authors are carving out a fairly specific set of features to describe the set of ""fair"" comparators from the literature. Given the variability of the models and alternate training datasets that are in use, I would find it more compelling if the authors just set about trying to achieve the best results they can, if that includes the fine-tuning of the frame model, so be it. The value of this work is as an application paper, so the discovery and incorporation of elements that can significantly improve performance would seems warranted.

Good to see the incorporation of memory in the context of video description generation. Although in general I like the paper, I have some feedback and questions. Most of my feedback corresponds to the discussion of the HAM at page 5 on the top and the experimental details.

1. During training, how many video frames 0..N are fed into the TEM? Is there any kind of temporal subsampling of the videos? From the text I get the impression that all the video frames are used during training, but wouldn't this cause unrolling the LSTMs for too many timesteps? (i.e. training difficulties and memory constraints)
2. Figure 1 would be a lot more useful if the arrows include the tensors that flow between them (e.g. F^ to the memory)

416,False,On the Expressive Power of Deep Neural Networks,"SUMMARY 
This paper studies the expressive power of deep neural networks under various related measures of expressivity. 
It discusses how these measures relate to the `trajectory length', which is shown to depend exponentially on the depth of the network, in expectation (at least experimentally, at an intuitive level, or theoretically under certain assumptions). 
The paper also emphasises the importance of the weights in the earlier layers of the network, as these have a larger influence on the represented classes of functions, and demonstrates this in an experimental setting. 

PROS 
The paper further advances on topics related to the expressive power of feedforward neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, in particular elaborating on the relations between various points of view. 

CONS 
The paper further advances and elaborates on interesting topics, but to my appraisal it does not contribute significantly new aspects to the discussion. 

COMMENTS
- The paper is a bit long (especially the appendix) and seems to have been written a bit in a rush. 
Overall the main points are presented clearly, but the results and conclusions could be clearer about the assumptions / experimental vs theoretical nature. 
The connection to previous works could also be clearer. 

- On page 2 one finds the statement ``Furthermore, architectures are often compared via ‘hardcoded’ weight values -- a specific function that can be represented efficiently by one architecture is shown to only be inefficiently approximated by another.'' 

This is partially true, but it neglects important parts of the discussion conducted in the cited papers. 
In particular, the paper [Montufar, Pascanu, Cho, Bengio 2014] discusses not one hard coded function, but classes of functions with a given number of linear regions. 
That paper shows that deep networks generically* produce functions with at least a given number of linear regions, while shallow networks never do. 
* Generically meaning that, after fixing the number of parameters, any function represented by the network, for parameter values form an open, positive -measure, neighbourhood, belongs to the class of functions which have at least a certain number of linear regions. 
In particular, such statements can be directly interpreted in terms of networks with random weights. 

- One of the measures for expressivity discussed in the present paper is the number of Dichotomies. In statistical learning theory, this notion is used to define the VC-dimension. In that context, a high value is associated with a high statistical complexity, meaning that picking a good hypothesis requires more data. 

- On page 2 one finds the statement ``We discover and prove the underlying reason for this – all three measures are directly proportional to a fourth quantity, trajectory length.'' 
The expected trajectory length increasing exponentially with depth can be interpreted as the increase (or decrease) in the scale by a composition of the form a*...*a x, which scales the inputs by a^d. Such a scaling by itself certainly is not an underlying cause for an increase in the number of dichotomies or activation patterns or transitions. Here it seems that at least the assumptions on the considered types of trajectories also play an important role. 
This is probably related to another observation from page 4: ``if the variance of the bias is comparatively too large... then we no longer see exponential growth.''

OTHER SPECIFIC COMMENTS 
In Theorem 1 
- Here it would be good to be more specific about ``random neural network'', i.e., fixed connectivity structure with random weights, and also about the kind of one-dimensional trajectory, i.e., finite in length, closed, differentiable almost everywhere, etc. 

- The notation ``g \geq O(f)'' used in the theorem reads literally as |g| \geq \leq k |f| for some k>0, for large enough arguments. It could also be read as g being not smaller than some function that is bounded above by f, which holds for instance whenever g\geq 0. 
For expressing asymptotic lower bounds one can use the notation \Omega (see",,6.0,5.0
417,False,On the Expressive Power of Deep Neural Networks,"This paper presents a theoretical and empirical approach to the problem of understanding the expressivity of deep networks.

Random networks (deep networks with random Gaussian weights, hard tanh or ReLU activation) are studied according to several criterions: number of neutron transitions, activation patterns, dichotomies and trajectory length.

There doesn't seem to be a solid justification for why the newly introduced measures of expressivity really measure expressivity.
For instance the trajectory length seems a very discutable measure of expressivity. The only justification given for why it should be a good measure of expressivity is proportionality with other measures of expressivity in the specific case of random networks.

The paper is too obscure and too long. The work may have some interesting ideas but it does not seem to be properly replaced in context.

Some findings seem trivial.

detailed comments

p2 

""Much of the work examining achievable functions relies on unrealistic architectural assumptions such as layers being exponentially wide""

I don’t think so. In ""Deep Belief Networks are Compact Universal Approximators"" by Leroux et al., proof is given that deep but narrow feed-forward neural networks with sigmoidal units can represent any Boolean expression i.e. A neural network with 2n−1 + 1 layers of n units (with n the number of input neutron).

“Comparing architectures in such a fashion limits the generality of the conclusions”

To my knowledge much of the previous work has focused on mathematical proof, and has led to very general conclusions on the representative power of deep networks (one example being Leroux et al again).

It is much harder to generalise the approach you propose, based on random networks which are not used in practice.

“[we study] a family of networks arising in practice: the behaviour of networks after random initialisation”

These networks arise in practice as an intermediate step that is not used to perform computations; this means that the representative power of such intermediate networks is a priori irrelevant. You would need to justify why it is not.

“results on random networks provide natural baselines to compare trained networks with”

random networks are not “natural” for the study of expressivity of deep networks. It is not clear how the representative power of random networks (what kind of random networks seems an important question here) is linked to the representative power of (i) of the whole class of networks or (ii) the class of networks after training. Those two classes of networks are the ones we would a priori care about and you would need to justify why the study of random networks helps in understanding either (i) or (ii).

p5

“As FW is a random neural network […] it would suggest that points far enough away from each other would have independent signs, i.e. a direct proportionality between the length of z(n)(t) and the number of times it crosses the decision boundary.”

As you say, it seems that proportionality of the two measures depends on the network being random. This seems to invalidate generalisation to other networks, i.e. if the networks are not random, one would assume that path lengths are not proportional.

p6

the expressivity w.r.t. remaining depth seems a trivial concerns, completely equivalent to the expressivity w.r.t. depth. This makes the remark in figure 5 that the number of achievable dichotomies only depends *only* on the number of layers above the layer swept seem trivial

p7

in figure 6 a network width of 100 for MNIST seems much too small. Accordingly performance is very poor and it is difficult to generalise the results to relevant situations.

A quick comment about motivation: our goal in this work improve interpretability in deep neural networks through a better understanding of neural network expressivity. In particular, we look at different ""diagnostics"" (transitions/activation patterns/dichotomies) for measuring the expressiveness of different neural network architectures, and their practical consequences. The surprising fact that three natural measures of expressiveness are related by *direct* proportion (see below) to trajectory length suggests consequences on remaining depth (earlier parameters are more important to fit the final function) and a trade off between expressivity and stability during training due to initialization choices.

Cons:
- Experimental evaluation does not touch upon recent models (ResNets) and large scale datasets (ImageNet)

- Feature map pruning can obviously accelerate computation without specialized sparse implementations of convolution, but this is not the case for finer grained sparsity; since this paper considers fine-grained sparsity it should provide some evidence that introducing that sparsity can yield performance improvements

Another experimental downside is that the paper does not evaluate the impact of filter pruning on transfer learning. For example, there is not much direct interest in the tasks of MNIST, CIFAR10, or even ImageNet. Instead, a main interest in both academia and industry is the value of the learned representation for transferring to other tasks. One might expect pruning to harm transfer learning. It's possible that the while the main task has about the same performance, transfer learning is strongly hurt. This paper has missed an opportunity to explore that direction.

1)	The method is somehow trivial, since the pruning masks are mainly chosen by simple random sampling. The novelty and scalability are both limited. 
2)	Experiment results are mainly focused on the classification rate and the ideal complexity. As a paper on improving computation efficiency, it should include results on practical time consumption. It is very common that reducing numbers of operations may not lead to reduced computational time on a highly parallel platform (e.g., GPU). 
3)	It is more important to improve the computational efficiency on large-scale models (e.g., ImageNet classification network) than on small models (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR network). However, results on large-scale network is missing.
4)	(*Logical validity of the proposed method*) For feature map pruning, what if just to train reduced-size network is trained from scratch without transfer any knowledge from the pretrained large network? Is it possible to get the same accuracy? If so, it will simply indicate the hyper-parameter is not optimal for the original network. Experimental results are necessary to clarify the necessity of feature map pruning. 
Note that I agree with that a smaller network may be more generalizable than a larger network.

A mixture model prior over the weights leads to a clustering effect in the weight posterior distributions (which are approximated with delta peaks). 
This clustering effect can exploited for parameter quantisation and compression of the network parameters.
The authors show that this leads to compression rates and predictive accuracy comparable to related approaches. 

Earlier work [Han et al. 2015] is based on a three-stage process of pruning small magnitude weights, clustering the remaining ones, and updating the cluster centres to optimise performance. The current work provides a more principled approach that does not have such an ad-hoc multi-stage structure, but a single iterative optimisation process.

A first experiment, described in section 6.1 shows that an empirical Bayes’ approach, without the use of hyper priors, already leads to a pronounced clustering effect and to setting many weights to zero. 
In particular a compression rate of 64.2 is obtained on the LeNet300-100 model.
In section 6.1 the text refers to figure C, I suppose this should be figure 1.

Section 6.2 describes an experiment where hyper-priors are used, and the parameters of these distributions, as well as other hyper-parameters such as the learning rates, are being optimised using Spearmint (Snoek et al., 2012). Figure 2 shows the performance of the  different points in the hyper-parameter space that have been evaluated (each trained network gives an accuracy-compressionrate point in the graph). The text claims that best results lie on a line, this seems a little opportunistic interpretation given the limited data. Moreover, it would be useful to add a small discussion on whether such a linear relationship would be expected or not. Currently the results of this experiment lack interpretation.

Section 6.3 describes results obtained for both CNN models and compares results to the recent results of (Han et al., 2015) and (Guo et al., 2016).
Comparable results are obtained in terms of compression rate and accuracy. 
The authors state that their current algorithm is too slow to be useful for larger models such as VGG-19, but they do briefly report some results obtained for this model (but do not compare to related work). It would be useful here to explain what slows the training down with respect to standard training without the weight clustering approach, and how the proposed algorithm scales in terms of the relevant quantities of the data and the model.

The contribution of this paper is mostly experimental, leveraging fairly standard ideas from empirical Bayesian learning to introduce weight clustering effects in CNN training.
This being said, it is an interesting result that such a relatively straightforward approach leads to results that are on par with state-of-the-art, but more ad-hoc, network compression techniques.
The paper could be improved by clearly describing the algorithm used for training, and how it scales to large networks and datasets.
Another point that would deserve further discussion is how the hyper-parameter search is performed ( not using test data I assume), and how the compared methods dealt with the search over hyper-parameters to determine the accuracy-compression tradeoff. Ideally, I think, methods should be evaluated across different points on this trade-off.

424,True,Soft Weight-Sharing for Neural Network Compression,"The authors propose a method to compress neural networks by retraining them while putting a mixture of Gaussians prior on the weights with learned means and variances which then can be used to compress the neural network by first setting all weights to the mean of their infered mixture component (resulting in a possible loss of precision) and storing the network in a format which saves only the fixture index and exploits the sparseness of the weights that was enforced in training.

Quality:
Of course it is a serious drawback that the method doesn't seem to work on VGG which would render the method unusable for production (as it is right now, maybe this can be improved). I guess AlexNet takes too long to process, too, otherwise this might be a very valuable addition.
In Figure 2 I am noticing two things: On the left, there is a large number of points with improved accuracy which is not the case for LeNet5-Caffe. Is there any intuition for why that's the case? Additionally regarding the spearmint optimization: Do they authors have found any clues about which hyperparameter settings worked well? This might be helpful for other people trying to apply this method.
I really like Figure 7 in it's latest version.

Clarity:
Especially section 2 on MDL is written very well and gives a nice theoretic introduction. Sections 4, 5 and 6 are very short but seem to contain most relevant information. It might be helpful to have at least some more details about the used models in the paper (maybe the number of layers and the number of parameters).
In 6.1 the authors claim ""Even though most variances seem to be reasonable small there are some that are large"". From figure 1 this is very hard to assess, especially as the vertical histogram essentially shows only the zero component. It might be helpful to have either a log histogram or separate histograms for each componenent. What are the large points in Figure 2 as opposed to the smaller ones? They seem to have a very good compression/accuracy loss ratio, is that it?
Some other points are listed below

originality: While there has been some work on compressing neural networks by using a reduced number of bits to store the parameters and exploiting sparsity structure, I like the idea to directly learn the quantization by means of a gaussian mixture prior in retraining which seems to be more principled than other approaches

significance: The method achievs state-of-the-art performance on the two shown examples on MNIST, however these networks are far from the deep networks used in state-of-the-art models. This obviously is a drawback for the practical usability of the methods and therefor it's significance. If the method could be made to work on more state-of-the-art networks like VGG or ResNet, I would consider this a contribution of high significance.

427,False,Implicit ReasoNet: Modeling Large-Scale Structured Relationships with Shared Memory,"[Summary]
This paper proposes a new way for knowledge base completion which highlights: 1) adopting an implicit shared memory, which makes no assumption about its structure and is completely learned during training; 2) modeling a multi-step search process that can decide when to terminate.

The experimental results on WN18 and FB15k seem pretty good. The authors also perform an analysis on a shortest path synthetic task, and demonstrate that this model is better than standard seq2seq.

The paper is well-written and it is easy to follow.

[Major comments]
I actually do like the idea and am also impressed that this model can work well.
The main concern is that this paper presents too little analysis about how it works and whether it is sensitive to the hyper-parameters, besides that only reporting a final model on WN18 and FB15k.

One key hyper-parameter I believe is the size of shared memory (using 64 for the experiments). I don’t think that this number should be fixed for all tasks, at least it should depend on the KB scale. Could you verify this in your experiments? Would it be even possible to make a memory structure with dynamic size?

The RL setting (stochastic search process) is also one highlight of the paper, but could you demonstrate that how much it does really help? I think it is necessary to compare to the following: remove the termination gate and fix the number of inference steps and see how well the model does? Also show how the performance varies on # of steps?

I appreciate your attempts on the shortest path synthetic task. However, I think it would be much better if you can demonstrate that under a real KB setting. You can still perform the shortest path analysis, but using KB  (e.g., Freebase) entities and relations.

431,False,TreNet: Hybrid Neural Networks for Learning the Local Trend in Time Series,"1) Summary

This paper proposes an end-to-end hybrid architecture to predict the local linear trends of time series. A temporal convnet on raw data extracts short-term features. In parallel, long term representations are learned via a LSTM on piecewise linear approximations of the time series. Both representations are combined using a MLP with one hidden layer (in two parts, one for each stream), and the entire architecture is trained end-to-end by minimizing (using Adam) the (l2-regularized) euclidean loss w.r.t. ground truth local trend durations and slopes.
 
2) Contributions

+ Interesting end-to-end architecture decoupling short-term and long-term representation learning in two separate streams in the first part of the architecture.
+ Comparison to deep and shallow baselines.

432,False,TreNet: Hybrid Neural Networks for Learning the Local Trend in Time Series,"Revision of the review:
The authors did a commendable job of including additional references and baseline experiments.

---

This paper presents a hybrid architecture for time series prediction, focusing on the slope and duration of linear trends. The architecture consists of combining a 1D convnet for local time series and an LSTM for time series of trend descriptors. The convnet and LSTM features are combined into an MLP for predicting either the slope or the duration of the next trend in a 1D time series. The method is evaluated on 3 small datasets.

Summary:
This paper, while relative well written and presenting an interesting approach, has several methodology flaws, that should be handled by new experiments.

Pros:
The idea of extracting upward or downward trends from time series - although these should, ideally be learned, not rely on an ad-hoc technique, given that this is a submission for ICLR.

Methodology:
* In section 3, what do you mean by predicting “either [the duration] $\hat l_t$ or [slope] $\hat s_t$” of the trend? Predictions are valid only if those two predictions are done jointly. The two losses should be combined during training.
* In the entire paper, the trend slope and duration need to be predicted jointly. Predicting a time series without specifying the horizon of the prediction is meaningless. If the duration of the trends is short, the time series could go up or down alternatively; if the duration of the trend is long, the slope might be close to zero. Predictions at specific horizons are needed.
* In general, time series prediction for such applications as trading and load forecasting is pointless if no decision is made. A trading strategy would be radically different for short-term and noisy oscillations or from long-term, stable upward or downward trend. An actual evaluation in terms of trading profit/loss should be added for each of the baselines, including the naïve baselines.
* As mentioned earlier in the pre-review questions, an important baseline is missing: feeding the local time series to the convnet and connecting the convnet directly to the LSTM, without ad-hoc trend extraction.
* The convnet -> LSTM architecture would need an analysis of the convnet filters and trend prediction representation.
* Trend prediction/segmentation by the convnet could be an extra supervised loss.
* The detailed analysis of the trend extraction technique is missing.
* In section 5, the SVM baselines have local trend and local time series vectors concatenated. Why isn’t the same approach used for LSTM baselines (as a multivariate input) and why the convnet operates only on local 
* An important, “naïve” baseline is missing: next local trend slope and duration = previous local trend slope and duration.

* Section 3 does not explain the selection of the maximal tolerable variance in each trend segment. The appendix should be moved to the core part of the paper.

The feature fusion layer can be expressed by a simple MLP on the concatenation of R(T(l)) and C(L(t)). Details could be moved to the appendix.

433,False,A Context-aware Attention Network for Interactive Question Answering,"This paper proposes an ""interactive"" version of the bAbI dataset by adding supporting questions/answers to the dataset in cases where there is not enough information to answer the question. Interactive QA is certainly an interesting problem and is well-motivated by the paper. However, I don't feel like the bAbI extension is adequately explained. For example, the baseline DMN and MemN2N models on the IQA task are ""take both statements and question as input and then
estimate an answer."" Their task is then fundamentally more difficult from the CAN's because they do not distinguish ""feedback"" from the original context; perhaps a more fair approach would be to treat **every** question (both supporting and original questions) as individual instances. Also, how were the supporting questions and the user feedback generated? How many templates / words were used to create them? The dataset creation details are missing, and if space is an issue, a lot of basic exposition on things like GRU / sentence encodings can be cut (or at least greatly shortened) and replaced with pointers to the original papers. 

Another issue I had is that the model attempts to generate these synthetic questions; if there are just one or two templates, why not just predict the values that fill these templates? So instead of generating ""Which bedroom, master one or guest one?"" with an RNN decoder, just predict ""which"" or ""which bedroom""... isn't this sufficient? In the end, these just seem like more supporting facts, not actual interaction with users, and the fact that it is run on only three of the original twenty tasks make the conclusions hard to trust.

--------------
This paper combines the recent progress in variational autoencoder and autoregressive density modeling in the proposed PixelVAE model. The paper shows that it can match the NLL performance of a PixelCNN with a PixelVAE that has a much shallower PixelCNN decoder.
I think the idea of capturing the global structure with a VAE and modeling the local structure with a PixelCNN decoder makes a lot of sense and can prevent the blurry reconstruction/samples of VAE. I specially like the hierarchical image generation experiments.

I have the following suggestions/concerns about the paper:

1) Is there any experiment showing that using the PixelCNN as the decoder of VAE will result in better disentangling of high-level factors of variations in the hidden code? For example, the authors can train a PixelVAE and VAE on MNIST with 2D hidden code and visualize the 2D hidden code for test images and color code each hidden code based on the digit and show that the digits have a better separation in the PixelVAE representation. A semi-supervised classification comparison between VAE and the PixelVAE will also significantly improve the quality of the paper.

2) A similar idea is also presented in a concurrent ICLR submission ""Variational Lossy Autoencoder"". It would be interesting to have a discussion included in the paper and compare these works.

3) The answer to the pre-review questions made the architecture details of the paper much more clear, but I still ask the authors to include the exact architecture details of all the experiments in the paper and/or open source the code. The clarity of the presentation is not satisfying and the experiments are difficult to reproduce.

4) As pointed out in my pre-review question, it would be great to include two sets of MNIST samples maybe in an appendix section. One with PixelCNN and the other with PixelVAE with the same pixelcnn depth to illustrate the hidden code in PixelVAE actually captures the global structure.

Are there any other differences, besides the KLD loss on latent variables and the (optional) hierarchical extension?

2. The introduction of latent varibles z definitely helps modeling global structure, however it also breaks the chain rule so the exact likelihood cannnot be derived.

443,False,Tartan: Accelerating Fully-Connected and Convolutional Layers in Deep Learning Networks by Exploiting Numerical Precision Variability,"The authors present TARTAN, a derivative of the previously published DNN accelerator architecture: “DaDianNao”. The key difference is that TARTAN’s compute units are bit-serial and unroll MAC operation over several cycles. This enables the units to better exploit any reduction in precision of the input activations for improvement in performance and energy efficiency.

Comments:

1. I second the earlier review requesting the authors to be present more details on the methodology used for estimating energy numbers for TARTAN. It is claimed that TARTAN gives only a 17% improvement in energy efficiency. However, I suspect that this small improvement is clearly within the margin of error ij energy estimation.  

2. TARTAN is a derivative of DaDianNao, and it heavily relies the overall architecture of DaDianNao. The only novel aspect of this contribution is the introduction of the bit-serial compute unit, which (unfortunately) turns out to incur a severe area overhead (of nearly 3x over DaDianNao's compute units).

3. Nonetheless, the idea of bit-serial computation is certainly quite interesting. I am of the opinion that it would be better appreciated (and perhaps be even more relevant) in a circuit design / architecture focused venue.",,5.0,5.0
444,False,Tartan: Accelerating Fully-Connected and Convolutional Layers in Deep Learning Networks by Exploiting Numerical Precision Variability,"Summary:

The paper describes how the DaDianNao (DaDN) DNN accelerator can be improved by employing bit serial arithmetic.  They replace the bit-parallel multipliers in DaDN with multipliers that accept the weights in parallel but the activations serially (serial x parallel multipliers).  They increase the number of units keeping the total number of adders constant.  This enables them to tailor the time and energy consumed to the number of bits used to represent activations.  They show how their configuration can be used to process both fully-connected and convolutional layers of DNNs.

Strengths:

Using variable precision for each layer of the network is useful - but was previously reported in Judd (2015)

Good evaluation including synthesis - but not place and route - of the units.  Also this evaluation is identical to that in Judd (2016b)

Weaknesses:

The idea of combining bit-serial arithmetic with the DaDN architecture is a small one.

The authors have already published almost everything that is in this paper at Micro 2016 in Judd (2016b).  The increment here is the analysis of the architecture on fully-connected layers.  Everything else is in the previous publication.

The energy gains are small - because the additional flip-flop energy of shifting the activations in almost offsets the energy saved on reducing the precision of the arithmetic.

The authors don’t compare to more conventional approaches to variable precision - using bit-parallel arithmetic units but data gating the LSBs so that only the relevant portion of the arithmetic units toggle.  This would not provide any speedup, but would likely provide better energy gains than the bit-serial x bit-parallel approach.

Overall:

The Tartan and Stripes architectures are interesting but the incremental contribution of this paper (adding support for fully-connected layers) over the three previous publications on this topic, and in particular Judd (2016b) is very small.  This idea is worth one good paper, not four.",,5.0,5.0

446,False,Learning Python Code Suggestion with a Sparse Pointer Network,"This paper takes a standard auto-regressive model of source code and augments it with a fixed attention policy that tracks the use of certain token types, like identifiers. Additionally they release a Python open source dataset. As expected this augmentation, the fixed attention policy, improves the perplexity of the model. It seems important to dig a bit deeper into these results and show the contribution of different token types to the achieve perplexity. This is alluded to in the text, but a more thorough comparison would be welcome. The idea of an attention policy that takes advantage of expert knowledge is a nice contribution, but perhaps if limited novelty --- for example the Maddison and Tarlow 2014 paper, which the authors cite, has scoping rules that track previously used identifiers in scope.",,5.0,4.0
447,False,Learning Python Code Suggestion with a Sparse Pointer Network,"This paper presents an improved neural language models designed for selected long-term dependency, i.e., to predict more accurately the next identifier for the dynamic programming language such as Python. The improvements are obtained by:

1) replacing the fixed-widow attention with a pointer network, in which the memory only consists of context representation of the previous K identifies introduced for the entire history. 
2) a conventional neural LSTM-based language model is combined with such a sparse pointer network with a controller, which linearly combines the prediction of both components using a dynamic weights, decided by the input, hidden state, and the context representations at the time stamp.

Such a model avoids the the need of large window size of the attention to predict next identifier, which usually requires a long-term dependency in the programming language. This is partly validated by the python codebase (which is another contribution of this paper) experiments in the paper.

While the paper still misses some critical information that I would like to see, including how the sparse pointer network performance chances with different size of K, and how computationally efficient it is for both training and inference time compared to LSTM w/ attention of various window size, and ablation experiments about how much (1) and (2) contribute respectively, it might be of interest to the ICLR community to see it accepted.

448,False,Learning Python Code Suggestion with a Sparse Pointer Network,"This paper uses a pointer network over a sparse window of identifiers to improve code suggestion for dynamically-typed languages. Code suggestion seems an area where attention and/or pointers truly show an advantage in capturing long term dependencies.

The sparse pointer method does seem to provide better results than attention for similar window sizes - specifically, comparing a window size of 20 for the attention and sparse pointer method shows the sparse pointer winning fairly definitively across the board. Given a major advantage of the pointer method is being able to use a large window size well thanks to the supervision the pointer provides, it was unfortunate (though understandable due to potential memory issues) not to see larger window sizes. Having a different batch size for the sparse pointer and attention models is unfortunate given it complicates an otherwise straight comparison between the two models.

The construction and filtering of the Python corpus sounds promising but as of now it is still inaccessible (listed in the paper as TODO). Given that code suggestion seems an interesting area for future long term dependency work, it may be promising as an avenue for future task exploration.

449,True,Making Neural Programming Architectures Generalize via Recursion,"This is a very interesting and fairly easy to read paper. 
The authors present a small, yet nifty approach to make Neural Programming Interpreters significantly more powerful. By allowing recursion, NPI generalizes better from fewer execution traces.
It's an interesting example of how a small but non-trivial extension can make a machine learning method significantly more practical.

I also appreciate that the same notation was used in this paper and the original Deepmind paper. As a non-expert on this topic, it was easy to read the original paper in tandem. 

My one point of critique is that the generalization proves are a bit vague. For the numerical examples in the paper, you can iterate over all possible execution paths until the next recursive call. However, how would this approach generalize a continuous input space (e.g. the 3D car example in the original paper). It seems that a prove of generalization will still be intractable in the continuous case?

450,False,Learning Continuous Semantic Representations of Symbolic Expressions,"This work proposes to compute embeddings of symbolic expressions (e.g., boolean expressions, or polynomials) such that semantically equivalent expressions are near each other in the embedded space.  The proposed model uses recursive neural networks where the architecture is made to match that of the parse tree of a given symbolic expression.  To train the model parameters, the authors create a dataset of expressions where semantic equivalence relationships are known and minimize a loss function so that equivalent expressions are closer to each other than non-equivalent expressions via a max-margin loss function.  The authors also use a “subexpression forcing” mechanism which, if I understand it correctly, encourages the embeddings to respect some kind of compositionality.

Results are shown on a few symbolic expression datasets created by the authors and the proposed method is demonstrated to outperform baselines pretty convincingly.  I especially like the PCA visualization where the action of negating an expression is shown to correspond roughly to negating the embedding in its vector space — it is a lot like the man - woman + queen = king type embeddings that we see in the word2vec and glove style papers.  

The weakest part of the paper is probably that the setting seems somewhat contrived — I can’t really think of a real setting where it is easy to have a training set of known semantic equivalences, but still more worth it to use a neural network to do predictions.   The authors have also punted on dealing with variable names, assuming that distinct variables refer to different entities in the domain.  This is understandable, as variable names add a whole new layer of complexity on an already difficult problem, but also seems high limiting.  For example, the proposed methods would not be useable in an “equation search engine” unless we were able to accurately canonicalize variable names in some way.

Other miscellaneous points:
* Regarding problem hardness, I believe that the problem of determining if two expressions are equivalent is actually undecidable — see the “word problem for Thue systems”.  Related to this, I was not able to figure out how the authors determine ground truth equivalence in their training sets.  They say that expressions are simplified into a canonical form and grouped, but this seems to not be possible in general, so one question is — is it possible that equivalent expressions in the training data would have been mapped to different canonical forms?  Would it have been easier/possible to construct and compare truth tables?
* The “COMBINE” operation uses what the authors describe as a residual-like connection.  Looking at the equations, the reason why this is not actually a residual connection is because of the weight matrix that is multiplied by the lower level l_0 features.  A true residual connection would have passed the features through unchanged (identity connection) and would have also been better at fighting gradient explosion…. so is there a reason why this was used rather than an identity connection?
* In table 3, the first tf-idf entry: a + (c+a) * c seems equivalent to a + (c * (a+c))
* Vertical spacing between Figure 4 caption and body of text is very small and looks like the caption continues into the body of the text.",,6.0,4.0
451,False,Learning Continuous Semantic Representations of Symbolic Expressions,"The authors propose a new model to learn symbolic expression representations. They do a reasonably extensive evaluation with similar approaches and motivate their approach well.

As expressed in the preliminary questions, I think the authors could improve the motivation for their subexpforce loss.

At the top of page 6 the authors mention that they compare to two-layer MLP w/o residual connections. I think having a direct comparison between a model with and w/o the subexpforce loss would be helpful too and should be included (i.e. keep the residual connections and normalization).

My main concern is the evaluation ""score"". It appears to be precision on a per query basis. I believe a more standard metric, precision-recall or roc would be more informative. In particular the chosen metric is expected to perform better when the equivalence classes are larger, since this isn't taken into account in the denominator, but the likelihood of a random expression matching the query increases.",,7.0,3.0
452,False,Learning Continuous Semantic Representations of Symbolic Expressions,"The goal of this paper is to learn vector representation of boolean and polynomial expressions, such that equivalent expressions have similar representations.

The model proposed in the paper is based on recursive neural network, as introduced by Socher et al. (2012). Given the syntactic parse tree of a formula (either boolean or polynomial), the representation for a node is obtained by applying a MLP on the representation of the children. This process is applied recursively to obtain the representation of the full expression. Contrary to Socher et al. (2012), this paper proposes to use more than one layer (this is especially important to capture XOR operation, which is not surprising at all). The paper also introduces a reconstruction error (called SubexpForce), so that the expression of children can be recovered from the expression of the parent (if I understood correctly). The model is trained using a classification loss, where the label of a given expression corresponds to its equivalence class. The method is then evaluated on randomly generated data, and compared to baselines such as tf-idf, GRU RNN or standard recursive neural network.

While I do agree with the authors that learning good representation for symbolic expressions (and to capture compositionality) is an important task, I am not entirely convinced by the experimental setting proposed in this paper. Indeed, as stated in the paper, the task of deciding if two boolean expressions are equivalent is NP-hard, and I do not understand if the model can do better than implicitly computing the truth table of expressions. While sometimes a bit hard to follow, the paper is technically sound. In particular, the proposed model is well adapted to the problem and outperforms the baselines.

pros:
 - the model is relatively simple and sound.
 - using a classification loss over equivalence classes (should be compared with using similarity).

cons:
 - not convinced by the setting: I do not believe that you can really do better than the truth table for boolean expr (or computing the value of the polynomial expression for randomly chosen points in [0, 1]^n).
 - some part of the paper are a bit hard to follow (e.g. justification of the SubexpForce, discussion of why softmax does not work, etc...).

453,True,Tighter bounds lead to improved classifiers,"The paper proposes an alternative to conditional max. log likelihood for training discriminative classifiers. The argument is that the conditional log. likelihood is an upper bound of the Bayes error which becomes lousy during training. The paper then proposes better bounds computed and optimized in an iterative algorithm. Extensions of this idea are developed for regularized losses and a weak form of policy learning. Tests are performed on different datasets.

An interesting aspect of the contribution is to revisit a well-accepted methodology for training classifiers. The idea looks fine and some of the results seem to validate it. This is however still a preliminary work and one would like to see the ideas pushed further. Globally, the paper lacks coherence and depth: the part on policy learning is not well connected to the rest of the paper and the link with RL is not motivated in the two examples (ROC optimization and uncertainties). The experimental part needs a rewriting, e.g. I did not find a legend for identifying the different curves in the figures, which makes difficult to appreciate the results.",,4.0,4.0

Consequently, the optimized upper bound (log-loss) gets looser. 

As a fix, an optimization procedure based on recomputing the bound is proposed. The paper is well written. While the main observation made in this paper is a well-known fact, it is presented in a clear and refreshing way that may make it useful to a wide audience at this venue. 

I would like to draw the author's attention to the close connections of this framework with curriculum learning. More on this can be found in [1] (which is a relevant reference that should be cited). A discussion on this could enrich the quality of the paper.

455,True,Tighter bounds lead to improved classifiers,"The paper proposes new bounds on the misclassification error. The bounds lead to training classifiers with an adaptive loss function, and the algorithm operates in successive steps: the parameters are trained by minimizing the log-loss weighted by the probability of the observed class as given by the parameters of the previous steps. The bound improves on standard log-likelihood when outliers/underfitting prevents the learning algorithm to properly optimize the true classification error. Experiments are performed to confirm the therotical intuition and motivation. They show different cases where the new algorithm leads to improved classification error because underfitting occurs when using standard log-loss, and other cases where the new bounds do not lead to any improvement because the log-loss is sufficient to fit the dataset.

The paper also discusses the relationship between the proposed idea and reinforcement learning, as well as with classifiers that have an ""uncertain"" label. 

While the paper is easy to read and well-written overall, in a second read I found it difficult to fully understand because two problems are somewhat mixed together (here considering only binary classification for simplicity): 
(a) the optimization of the classification error of a *randomized* classifier, which predicts 1 with probability P(1|x, theta), and 
(b) the optimization of the deterministic classifier, which predicts sign(P(1|x, theta) - 0.5), in a way that is robust to outliers/underfitting. 

The reason why I am confused is that ""The standard approach to supervised classification"", as is mentioned in the abstract, is to use deterministic classifiers at test time, and the log-loss (up to constants) is an upper bound on the classification error of the deterministic classifier. However, the bounds discussed in the paper only concern the randomized classifier.

=== question:
In the experiments, what kind of classifier is used? The randomized one (as would the sentence in the first page suggest ""Assuming the class is chosen according to p(y|X, θ)""), or the more standard deterministic classifier argmax_y P(y|x, theta) ?

As far as I can see, there are two cases: either (i) the paper deals with learning randomized classifiers, in which case it should compare the performances with the deterministic counterparts that people use in practice, or (ii) the paper makes sense as soon as we accept that the optimization of criterion (a) is a good surrogate for (b). In both cases,  I think the write-up should be made clearer (because in case (ii) the algorithm does not minimize an upper bound on the classification error, and in case (i) what is done does not correspond to what is usually done in binary classification). 

=== comments:
- The section ""allowing uncertainty in the decision"" may be improved by adding some references, e.g. Bartlett & Wegkamp (2008) ""Classification with a Reject Option using a Hinge Loss"" or Sayedi et al. (2010) ""Trading off Mistakes and Don’t Know Predictions"".

- there seems to be a ""-"" sign missing in the P(1|x, theta) in L(theta, lambda) in Section 3.

- The idea presented in the paper is interesting and original. While I give a relatively low score for now, I am willing to increase this score if the clarifications are made.

Final comments:
I think the paper is clear enough in its current form, even though there should still be improvement in the justification of why and to what extent the error of the randomized classifier is a good surrogate for the error of the true classifier. While the ""smoothed"" version of the 0/1 loss is an acceptable explanation in the standard classification setup, it is less clear in the section dealing with an additional ""uncertain"" label.

1- linear vs non-linear: I think studying linear networks is valuable but we should be careful not to extend the results to networks with non-linear activations without enough evidence. This is especially true for Hessian as the Hessian of non-linear networks have very large condition number (see the ICLR submission ""Singularity of Hessian in Deep Learning"") even in cases where the optimization is not challenging. Therefore, I don't agree with the claims in the paper on non-linear networks. Moreover, one plot on MNIST is not enough to claim that non-linear networks behave similar to linear networks.

459,False,Demystifying ResNet,"This paper studies the optimization issue of linear ResNet, and shows mathematically that for 2-shortcuts and zero initialization, the Hessian has condition number independent of depth. I skimmed through the proof but have not checked them carefully. 

This result is a nice observation for training deep linear networks.  But I do not think the paper has fully resolved the linear vs nonlinear issue. Some question:

1. Though the revision has added some results using ReLU units, it seems it is only added to the mid positions of the network (sec 5.3), is this how it is typically done in ResNet? Moreover, ReLU is not differentiable at zero point, which does not satisfy the condition you had in Theorem 1. Why not use differentiable activations like sigmoid or tanh?

2. From equation (22) in the appendix, it seems for nonlinear activations, the condition number depends on the derivative \sigma^\prime at 0. Therefore, if we use tanh which has derivative 1 at zero, the condition number is the same for linear and tanh activations. But this probably is not enough to explain the bit difference in performance or optimization for linear and nonlinear networks, or how the situations evolve after learning the 0 point.

3. As for the success of ResNet (or convnets in general) in computer vision, I believe there are more types of nonlinearity such as pooling? Can the result here generalizes to pooling as well?

Minor: 
- sec 1 last paragraph, low approximation error typically means more powerful model class and better training error, but not necessarily better test error

I went through your paper in detail and it was very good linking the Hessian at the zero initial point to the success of the ResNet.

Across several standard refernces, the condition number is defined as the ratio the maximum and minimum singular values where as you defined it as $ |\lambda|_max / |\lambda|_min  $.  Unless the matrix, which is the Hessian H in your case, is positive semi-definite, these two are not the same and the spectra of the singular values and the eigen values can be quite different in general.

In addition, the paper discusses the approach’s relationship to variational autoencoders.

Given that the approach to rate-distortion optimization has already been published, the novelty of this submission is arguably not very high (correct me if I missed a new trick). In some ways, this paper even represents a step backward, since earlier work optimized for a perceptual metric where here MSE is used. However, the results are a visible improvement over JPEG 2000, and I don’t know of any other learned encoding which has been shown to achieve this level of performance.

The authors provided a thoughtful response to my pre-review question. I would still argue that to minimize distortion under a fixed range and quantization, a sufficiently complex network would learn automatically produce  codes within a fixed range with the highest-possible entropy (i.e., it would meet the upper bound).

Evaluation is a big concern. There is no quantitative evaluation. There is no comparision with other methods.

471,False,Recurrent Inference Machines for Solving Inverse Problems,"This paper proposes the RIMs that unrolls variational inference procedure. 

The author claims that the novelty lies in the separation of the model and inference procedure, making the MAP inference as an end-to-end approach. The effectiveness is shown in image restoration experiments.

While unrolling the inference is not new, the author does raise an interesting perspective towards the `model-free' configuration, where model and inference are not separable and can be learnt jointly. 

However I do not quite agree the authors' argument regarding [1] and [2]. Although both [1] and [2] have pre-defined MAP inference problem. It is not necessarily that a separate step is required. In fact, both do not have either a pre-defined prior model or an explicit prior evaluation step as shown in Fig. 1(a). I believe that the implementation of both follows the same procedure as the proposed, that could be explained through Fig. 1(c). That is to say, the whole inference procedure eventually becomes a learnable neural network and the energy is implicitly defined through learning the parameters.  

Moreover, the RNN block architecture (GRU) and non-linearity (tanh) restrict the flexibility and implicitly form the inherent family of variational energy and inference algorithm. This is also similar with [1] and [2].

Based on that fact, I have the similar feeling with R1 that the novelty is somewhat limited. Also some discussions should be added in terms of the architecture and nonlinearity that you have chosen. ",,5.0,4.0
472,False,Recurrent Inference Machines for Solving Inverse Problems,"Unfortunately, even after reading the authors' response to my pre-review question, I feel this paper in its current form lacks sufficient novelty to be accepted to ICLR.

Fundamentally, the paper suggests that traditional iterative algorithms for specific class of problems (ill-posed image inverse problems) can be replaced by discriminatively trained recurrent networks. As R3 also notes, un-rolled networks for iterative inference aren't new: they've been used to replace CRF-type inference, and _also_ to solve image inverse problems (my refs [1-3]). Therefore, I'd argue that the fundamental idea proposed by the paper isn't new---it is just that the paper seeks to 'formalize' it as an approach for inverse problems (although, there is nothing specific about the analysis that ties it to inverse problems: the paper only shows that the RIM can express gradient descent over prior + likelihood objective).

I also did not find the claims about benefits over prior approaches very compelling. The comment about parameter sharing works both ways---it is possible that untying the parameters leads to better performance over a fewer number of 'iterations', and given that the 'training set' is synthetically generated, learning a larger number of parameters doesn't seem to be an issue. Also, I'd argue that sharing the parameters is the 'obvious' approach, and the prior methods choose to not tie the parameters to get better accuracy.

The same holds for being able to handle different noise levels / scale sizes. A single model can always be trained to handle multiple forms of degradation---its just that its likely to do better when it's trained for specific degradation model/level. But more importantly, there is no evidence in the current set of experiments that shows that this is a property of the RIM architecture. (Moreover, this claim goes against one of the motivations of the paper of not training a single prior for different observation models ... but to train the entire inference architecture end-to-end).

It is possible that the proposed method does offer practical benefits beyond prior work---but these benefits don't come from the idea of simply unrolling iterations, which is not novel. I would strongly recommend that the authors consider a significant re-write of the paper---with a detailed discussion of prior work mentioned in the comments that highlights, with experiments, the specific aspects of their recurrent architecture that enables better recovery for inverse problems. I would also suggest that to claim the mantle of 'solving inverse problems', the paper consider a broader set of inverse tasks---in-painting, deconvolution, different noise models, and possibly working with multiple observations (like for HDR).",,4.0,4.0
473,False,Classify or Select: Neural Architectures for Extractive Document Summarization,"This paper provides two RNN-based architectures for extractive document summarization. The first, ""Classify"", reads in the whole document and traverses the sentences a second time to decide whether to include them or not (0/1 decisions). The second, ""Select"",  reads in the whole document and picks the most relevant sentence one at the time. The models assume that oracle extractive summaries exist, and a pseudo ground-truth generation procedure is used, which mimics Svore et al. (2007) among others. 

Overall, this paper seems a small increment over Cheng & Lapata (2016) and performance is similar or worse to that paper. The problem of single document extractive summarization is not particularly exciting since in DUC 2002 (14 years ago) existing models could not beat the lead baseline (which selects the first sentences of the document). It's a pity that this paper doesn't address the most interesting problems of abstractive summarization or apply the proposed approach to multi-document summarization. It's also a little disappointing that the maximum sentence length had to be capped to 50, which suggests the model has some trouble to scale.",,4.0,4.0

Technical comments:

- In equation (1), there is a position-relevant component call ""positional importance"". I am wondering how important this component is? Is it possible to show the performance without this component? Especially, for the discussion on impact of document structure, when the model is trained on the shuffled order but tested on the original order.
- A similar question about equation (1), is the content-richness component really necessary? Since the score function already has salience part, which could measure how important of $h_j$ with respect to the whole document.
- For the dynamic summary representation in equation (3), why not use the same updating equation for both training and test procedures? During test time, the model actually knows the decisions that have been made so far by the decoder. In this way, the model will be more consistent during training and test. 
- I think section 5 is the most interesting part of this paper, and it is also convincing on the difference between the two architectures.
- It is a little disappointing that the decoding algorithm used in this paper is too simple. In a minimal case, both of them could use beam search and the results could be better.",,6.0,4.0
475,False,Classify or Select: Neural Architectures for Extractive Document Summarization,"This paper presents two RNN architectures for extractive document summarization. The first one, Classifier, takes into account the order in which sentences appear in the original document, whereas the second one, Selector, chooses sentences in an arbitrary order. For each architecture, the concatenated RNN hidden state from a sentence forward and backward pass  is used as features to compute a score that captures content richness, salience, positional importance, and redundancy. Both models are trained in a supervised manner, so the authors used ""pseudo-ground truth generation"" to create training data from abstractive summaries. Experiments show that the Classifier model performs better, and it achieves near state-of-the-art performance for some evaluation metrics.

The proposed model is in general an extension of Cheng and Lapata, 2016. Unfortunately, the performance is only slightly better or sometimes even worse. The authors mentioned that one key difference how they transform abstractive summaries to become gold labels for the supervised method. However, in the experiment results, the authors described that one potential reason their models do not consistently outperform the extractive model of Cheng & Lapata, 2016 is that the unsupervised greedy approximation may generate noisier ground truth labels than Cheng & Lapata. Is there a reason to construct the training data similar to Cheng & Lapata, if that turns out to be a better method?
In order for the proposed models to be convincing, they need to outperform this baseline that's very similar to the proposed methods more consistently, since the main contribution is improved neural architectures for extractive document summarization.

476,False,Improving Invariance and Equivariance Properties of Convolutional Neural Networks,"This paper is an extension of Lenc&Vedaldi15 paper, showing CNN representations at FC7 layer are to certain extent equivariant to various classes of transformations and that training with a certain group of transformation makes the representations more equivalent.

Authors performed a large amount of experiments, training over 30 networks with different forms of jitter, which is quite impressive. However it is rather difficult to find a main message of this work. Yes, authors measured the properties on a different layer than the Lenc&Vedaldi15, however it is hard to find some novel insights other than the known fact that jitter helps to achieve invariance. The evaluation seems to be mostly correct, however the paper does not seem to be solving the task advertised in its title really well.

Major issues are in the experiments with the representation distances:
* The selection of only FC7 is a bit controversial - it is followed only by a single classification layer (FC8) to the common output - class likelyhoods. Because the FC8 is just a linear projections, what the equivalence map does is just to re-project the FC8 weights of the attached network to the weights of the original network. Probably performing similar experiments but on more layers may be more useful (as the networks are already trained).
* The experiment with representation distance is missing what is the classification error on the testing dataset. This would answer whether the representations are actually compatible up to linear transformation at all...
* It is not clear for the experiment with K-NN whether this is measured per each test set example? After training the equivalence map? More clear would be to show that networks trained on similar group of jitter transformations are more compatible on the target task.
* The proposed method does not seem to improve equivariance consistently on all tasks. Especially with \lambda_1 and \lambda_2 having such small values, the loss is basically equal to simple data jitter as it just adds up the loss of the original and transformed image. Maybe the issue is in the selection of the FC7 layer?

In general, this paper shows some interesting results on the FC7 equivariance, but it does not seem to be drawing many interesting new observations out of these experiments. Due to some issues with the equivalence experiments and the finetuning of equivariance, I would not recommend acceptance of this manuscript. However, refining the experiments on already trained networks and restructuring this manuscript into more investigative work may lead to interesting contribution to the field.

There are also few minor issues:
* It is not experimentally verified that the new criterion for equivariance mapping helps to gain better results.
* The angles on page 1 and 5 are missing units (degrees?).
* On page three, ""In practice, it is difficult... "", it is not M_g which is maximised/minimised, but the loss over the M_g
* Page 4, footnote 2 - if you are just halving the activations, it is hard to call it a dropout as this constant factor can be passed to the following/preceding weights
* Is the network for RVL-CDIP the same architecture as Alexnet?
* On page 7, Figure 3a+3b - in my opinion, turning the diagonal elements to white is really misleading, and probably even incorrect, as the distance between the same representations should be zero (which is also a way how to verify that the experiments are performed correctly).",,4.0,5.0
477,False,Improving Invariance and Equivariance Properties of Convolutional Neural Networks,"This paper empirically studies the invariance, equivariance and equivalence properties of representations learned by convolutional networks under various kinds of data augmentation. Additional loss terms are presented which can make a representation more invariant or equivariant.

The idea of measuring invariance, equivariance and equivalence of representations is not new (Lenc & Vedaldi). The authors are the first to systematically study the effect of data augmentation on these properties, but it is unclear in what way the results are surprising, interesting, or useful. It is not really surprising that data augmentation increases invariance, or that training with the same augmentation leads to more similar representations than training with different augmentations.

Regarding the presented method to increase invariance and equivariance: while it could be that a representation will generalize better if it is invariant or equivariant, it is not clear why one would want to increase in/equivariance if it does not indeed lead to improvements in performance. The paper presents no evidence that training for increased invariance / equivariance leads to substantial improvements in performance. Combined with the fact that the loss (eq. 6) would substantially increase the computational burden, I don’t think this technique will be very useful.

Minor comments:
-R^{nxn} should be R^{n \times n}
-In eq. 2: ‘equivaraince’
-In 3.3, argmax is not properly formatted
-I think data augmentation was already considered essential before Krizhevsky et al. Not really correct to attribute this to them.
- About the claim “This is related to the idea of whether CNNs collapse (invariance) or linearize (equivariance) view manifolds of 3D objects”. The idea that equivariance means that the manifold (orbit) is linearized, is incorrect. A linear representation M_g can create nonlinear manifolds. A simple example is given by a rotation matrix in 2D (clearly linear), generating a nonlinear manifold (the circle). 
- Equivariance in eq. 2 should be called “non-equivariance”. If the value is low, the representation is equivariant, while if it is high it is non-equivariant.
- “Eq. 2  also uses the paradigm that”, uses the word paradigm in a strange manner
- In the definition of x’_ij, should one of the g_j be inverted? Otherwise it seems like the transformation is applied twice, instead of being undone.

478,False,Improving Invariance and Equivariance Properties of Convolutional Neural Networks,"This work presents an empirical study of the influence of different types of data augmentation on the performance of CNNs. It also proposes to incorporate additional loss functions to encourage approximate invariance or equivariance, and shows there are some benefits.

The paper reads well and the objectives are clear. The study of invariances in CNNs is a very important topic, and advances in this area are greatly appreciated. The paper splits itself in two very different parts -- the empirical study of equivariances in existing CNNs, and the proposal of equivariance objectives. However, taken separately each of these two parts could be better executed.

On the empirical study, its breath is relatively limited, and it's hard to draw any far-reaching conclusions from it:
- Only one network is studied; at least one other architecture would have made for better generalization.
- Only one layer (fc7) is studied; this presents issues as the top layer is the most invariant. At least one convolutional layer (possibly more) should have been considered.
- The reliance on the scanned text dataset does not help; however the ImageNet results are definitely very encouraging.

It is nice to see how performance degrades with the degree of transformations, and the authors do interpret the results, but it would be better to see more analysis. There is only a limited set of conclusions that can be drawn from evaluating networks with jittered data. If the authors could propose some other interesting ways to assess the invariance and equivariance, they would potentially draw more insightful conclusions from it.

On the proposed loss function, only a very quick treatment of it is given (Section 4, half a page). It does not differ too much from known invariance/equivariance objectives studied in the literature previously, e.g. Decoste and Scholkopf, ""Training Invariant Support Vector Machines"", Machine Learning, 2002.

I'm not sure that dividing the paper into these two different contributions is the best approach; they both feel a bit incomplete, and a full treatment of only one of them would make for an overall better paper.

Learning state representations is an active and useful area of research for learning representations in interactive domains such as robotics. However, there seems to be no novelty in the method, over Jonschkowki & Brock. The primary contribution is the experimental evaluation performed on one task, where the paper evaluates the correlation between the learned state representation and the ideal state representation for the task (which is the robot’s head position).

As acknowledged by the authors, the experiments are very preliminary, only showing one simple task with a one-dimensional learned representation and a two-dimensional discrete action space.

These tasks are difficult for recent DeepRL methods due to high-dimensional, variable action spaces (the action space is the task of each unit, the number of units may vary). In such large action spaces, simple exploration strategies (such as epsilon-greedy) perform poorly.

They introduce a novel algorithm ZO to tackle this problem. This algorithm combines ideas from policy gradient, deep networks trained with backpropagation for state embedding and gradient free optimization. The algorithm is well explained and is compared to some existing baselines. Due to the gradient free optimization providing for much better structured exploration, it performs far better.

This is a well-written paper and a novel algorithm which is applied to a very relevant problem. After the success of DeepRL approaches at learning in large state spaces such as visual environment, there is significant interest in applying RL to more structured state and action spaces. The tasks introduced here are interesting environments for these sorts of problems.

The main contribution of this paper is the zero-order optimization algorithm and how it is used for structured exploration. This is a nice new application of zero-order optimization meets deep learning for RL, quite well-motivated using similar arguments as DPG. The results show clear wins over vanilla Q-learning and REINFORCE, which is not hard to believe. Although RTS is a very interesting and challenging domain (certainly worthy as a domain of focused research!), it would have been nice to see results on other domains, mainly because it seems that this algorithm could be more generally applicable than just RTS games. Also, evaluation on such a complex domain makes it difficult to predict what other kinds of domains would benefit from this zero-order approach. Maybe the authors could add some text to clarify/motivate this.

There are a few seemingly arbitrary choices that are justified only by ""it worked in practice"". For example, using only the sign of w / Psi_{theta}(s^k, a^k). Again later: ""Also we neglected the argmax operation that chooses the actions"". I suppose this and dividing by t could keep things nicely within or close to [-1,1] ? It might make sense to try truncating/normalizing w/Psi; it seems that much information must be lost when only taking the sign. Also lines such as ""We did not extensively experiment with the structure of the network, but we found the maxpooling and tanh nonlinearity to be particularly important"" and claiming the importance of adagrad over RMSprop without elaboration or providing any details feels somewhat unsatisfactory and leaves the reader wondering why.. e.g. could these only be true in the RTS setup in this paper?

The presentation of the paper can be improved, as some ideas are presented without any context making it unnecessarily confusing. For example, when defining f(\tilde{s}, c) at the top of page 5, the w vector is not explained at all, so the reader is left wondering where it comes from or what its use is. This is explained later, of course, but one sentence on its role here would help contextualize its purpose (maybe refer later to the section where it is described fully).

As mentioned in an earlier comment, I don’t see why the “gradient of the average cumulative reward” is a reasonable choice, as compared to just the average reward? This over-weights late rewards at the expense of early ones, so the updates are not matching the measured objective. The authors state that they “did not observe a large difference in preliminary experiments” -- so if that is the case, then why not choose the correct objective?

DPQ is characterized incorrectly: despite its name, it does not “collect traces by following deterministic policies”, instead it follows a stochastic behavior policy and learns off-policy about the deterministic policy. Please revise this. 

Gradient-free optimization is also characterized incorrectly (“it only scales to few parameters”), recent work has shown that this can be overcome (e.g. the TORCS paper by Koutnik et al, 2013).

Specifically, the paper focuses on what the authors call ""monotonic chains of linear segments"", which are essentially sets of intersecting tangent planes. The paper presents a construction that efficiently models such manifolds in a deep net, and presents a basic error analysis of the resulting construction.

While the presented results are novel to the best of my knowledge, they are hardly surprising (1) given what we already know about the representational power of deep networks and (2) given that the study selects a deep network architecture and a data structure that are very ""compatible"". In particular, I have three main concerns with respect to the results presented in this paper:

(1) In the last decade, there has been quite a bit of work on learning data representations from sets of local tangent planes. Examples that spring to mind are local tangent space analysis of Zhang & Zha (2002), manifold charting by Brand (2002) and alignment of local models by Verbeek, Roweis, and Vlassis (2003). None of this work is referred to in related work, even though it seems highly relevant to the analysis presented here. For instance, it would be interesting to see how these old techniques compare to the deep network trained to produce the embedding of Figure 6. This may provide some insight into the inductive biases the deep net introduces: does it learn better representations that non-parametric techniques because it has better inductive biases, or does it learn worse representations because the loss being optimized is non-convex?

(2) It is difficult to see how the analysis generalizes to more complex data in which local linearity assumptions on the data manifold are vacuous given the sparsity of data in high-dimensional space, or how it generalizes to deep network architectures that are not pure ReLU networks. For instance, most modern networks use a variant of batch normalization; this already appears to break the presented analyses.

(3) The error bound presented in Section 4 appears vacuous for any practical setting, as the upper bound on the error is exponential in the total curvature (a quantity that will be quite large in most practical settings). This is underlined by the analysis of the Swiss roll dataset, of which the authors state that the ""bound for this case is very loose"". The fact that the bound is already so loose for this arguably very simple manifold makes that the error analysis may tell us very little about the representational power of deep nets.

I would encourage the authors to address issue (1) in the revision of the paper. Issue (2) and (3) may be harder to address, but is essential that they are addressed for the line of work pioneered by this paper to have an impact on our understanding of deep learning.


Minor comments: 

- In prior work, the authors only refer to fully supervised siamese network approaches. These approaches differ from that taken by the authors, as their approach is unsupervised. It should be noted that the authors are not the first to study unsupervised representation learners parametrized by deep networks: other important examples are deep autoencoders (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006 and work on denoising autoencoders from Bengio's group) and parametric t-SNE (van der Maaten, 2009).
- What loss do the authors use in their experiments? Using ""the difference between the ground truth distance ... and the distance computed by the network"" seems odd, because it encourages the network to produce infinitely large distances (to get a loss of minus infinity). Is the difference squared?",,6.0,3.0
491,True,Efficient Representation of Low-Dimensional Manifolds using Deep Networks,"Summary:
In this paper, the authors look at the ability of neural networks to represent low dimensional manifolds efficiently e.g. embed them into a lower dimensional Euclidian space. 
They define a class of manifolds, monotonic chains (affine spaces that intersect, with hyperplanes separating monotonic intervals of spaces) and give a construction to embed such a chain with a neural network with one hidden layer.

They also give a bound on the number of parameters required to do so, and examine what happens when the manifold is noisy. 

Experiments involve looking at embedding synthetic data from a monotonic chain using a distance preservation loss. This experiment supports the theoretical bound on number of parameters needed to embed the monotonic chain. Another experiment varies the elevation and azimuth of of faces, which are known to lie on a monotonic chain, on a regression loss.

Comments:

The direction of investigation in the paper (looking at what happens to manifolds in a neural network), is very compelling, and I strongly encourage the authors to continue exploring this direction.

However, the current version of the paper could use some more work:

The experiments are all with a regression loss and a shallow network, and as part of the reason for interest in this question is the very large, high dimensional datasets we use now, which require a deeper network, it seems important to address this case.

It also seems important to confirm that embedding works well when *classification* loss is used, instead of regression

The theory sections could do with being more clearly written -- I’m not as familiar with the literature in this area, and while the proof method used is relatively elementary, it was difficult to understand what exactly was being proved -- e.g. formally stating what could be expected of an embedding that “accurately and efficiently” preserves a monotonic chain, etc.

492,False,Learning Approximate Distribution-Sensitive Data Structures,"The paper presents a way to ""learn"" approximate data structures. They train neural networks (ConvNets here) to perform as an approximate abstract data structure by having an L2 loss (for the unrolled NN) on respecting the axioms of the data structure they want the NN to learn. E.g. you NN.push(8), NN.push(6), NN.push(4), the loss is proportional to the distance with what is NN.pop()ed three times and 4, 6, 8 (this example is the one of Figure 1).

There are several flaws:
 - In the case of the stack: I do not see a difference between this and a seq-to-seq RNN trained with e.g. 8, 6, 4 as input sequence, to predict 4, 6, 8.
 - While some of the previous work is adequately cited, there is an important body of previous work (some from the 90s) on learning Peano's axioms, stacks, queues, etc. that is not cited nor compared to. For instance [Das et al. 1992], [Wiles & Elman 1995], and more recently [Graves et al. 2014], [Joulin & Mikolov 2015], [Kaiser & Sutskever 2016]...
 - Using MNIST digits, and not e.g. a categorical distribution on numbers, is adding complexity for no reason.
 - (Probably the biggest flaw) The experimental section is too weak to support the claims. The figures are adequate, but there is no comparison to anything. There is also no description nor attempt to quantify a form of ""success rate"" of learning such data structures, for instance w.r.t the number of examples, or w.r.t to the size of the input sequences. The current version of the paper (December 9th 2016) provides, at best, anecdotal experimental evidence to support the claims of the rest of the paper.

494,False,Universality in halting time,"The idea of universality that is independent of input distribution and dimension, depending only on the algorithm is an appealing one. However, as an empirical study, this paper comes up somewhat short:

1. Exactly one algorithm is shown for the deep learning example. It would have been more convincing to compare distributions with one or more algorithms. 

2. The definition (1),  and much of the work of Section 2.1 seems to have already been covered in Deift (2014), Section 1.3. In that paper, a number of different algorithms for the solution of linear systems are considered, and then the concept of universality becomes more plausible. I do not see enough of such algorithmic comparisons in this paper (same problem setup, different algorithms).

3.  It seems to me that what practitioners might care about in practice are both the mean and variance in running times; these quantities are buried in (1). So I question how useful the distribution itself might be for algorithm tuning. 

At the least, many more empirical comparisons should be provided to convince me that the universality holds across a broad range of algorithms.",,5.0,4.0
495,False,Universality in halting time,"The authors explore whether the halting time distributions for various algorithms in various settings exhibit ""universality"", i.e. after rescaling to zero mean and unit variance, the distribution does not depend on stopping parameter, dimensionality and ensemble.

The idea of the described universality is very interesting. However I see several shortcomings in the paper:

In order to be of practical relevance, the actual stopping time might be more relevant than the scaled one. The discussion of exponential tailed halting time distributions is a good start, but I am not sure how often this might be actually helpful. Still, the findings in the paper might be interesting from a theoretical point of view.

Especially for ICLR, I think it would have been more interesting to look into comparisons between stochastic gradient descent, momentum, ADAM etc on different deep learning architectures. Over which of those parameters does universality hold?. How can different initializations influence the halting time distribution? I would expect a sensible initialization to cut of part of the right tail of the distribution.

Additionally, I found the paper quite hard to read. Here are some clarity issues:

- abstract: ""even when the input is changed drastically"": From the abstract I'm not sure what ""input"" refers to, here
- I. Introduction: ""where the stopping condition is, essentially, the time to find the minimum"": this doesn't seem to make sense, a condition is not a time. I guess the authors wanted to say that the stopping condition is that the minimum has been reached?
- I.1 the notions of dimension N, epsilon and ensemble E are introduced without any clarification what they are. From the later parts of the paper I got some ideas and examples, but here it is very hard to understand what these parameters should be (just some examples would be already helpful)
- I.3 ""We use x^\ell for \ell \in Z=\{1, \dots, S\} where Z is a random sample from of training samples"" This formulation doesn't make sense. Either Z is a random sample, or Z={1, ..., S}.
- II.1 it took me a long time to find the meaning of M. As this parameter seems to be crucial for universality in this case, it would be very helpful to point out more explicitly what it refers to.

496,False,Universality in halting time,"It is an interesting paper. However, I would like to describe a hypothesis/counter-example and I hope you will
easily reject it. Otherwise, I will fail to see any universality in the discussed ""universality in halting time"".

I would like to present a toy minimization problem where f(x) is defined in [0,1] and has two global
optima in 0.0 and 1.0 respectively. f(x) has its maximum in 0.5 but f(x) decays somewhat differently to the ""left""
and to the ""right"" optima. These somewhat different decays (shapes of f(x)) impact the way some optimizer A minimizes
f(x). My A can be e.g. a deterministic local search algorithm such that if it is initialized in the basin of attraction [0,0.5], it will stay/search there. Thus, the starting position will determine in which global optima it will end up. To observe the halting distribution, I run A starting from different starting positions generated uniformly at random in [0,1]. I expect the halting distribution to have two peaks: the first peak corresponds to a typical number of iterations required to reach some epsilon around the ""left"" optima, the second peak would correspond to the ""right"" optima. Question: Why there are two peaks and not one? Answer: Because, as mentioned before, the shapes/decays of f(x) on the left and right side are different and this affects our algorithm A, i.e., the number of iterations to reach some epsilon precision. Question: Is this a problem to have two peaks in the halting distribution not like the ones shown in figures? Answer: No, it is perfectly fine. What is not fine is that when I run the same algorithm A on another problem which is unimodal, then I will get a completely different halting distribution, e.g., like the ""one peak"" ones shown in the paper. Question: Where is the problem? Answer: The problem is that these observations contradict the discussed universality in halting time distribution which is an intrinsic thing to A and does not depend on the problem. Question: This was stated for large dimension N and not one-dimensional problem. Answer: Increase the dimensionality of the toy problem preserving the idea of the two (multiple) optima with, e.g., basins of attraction of equal size (keep in mind the  course of dimensionality). Question: There is a restriction on the class of ensembles E. Answer: If we restrict our-self to unimodal problems then I barely see ""universality"". Moreover, unimodal non-convex problems may exhibit the same properties as multi-modal ones, e.g., make a horizontal one-dimensional slice of 2-dimensional Rosenbrock function. Question: Why we see these nice-looking distribution for very different problems? Answer: because for some problems the multi-modality is negligeable and the dynamical system behind the optimizer may behave similarly for different values of N, especially for the large ones. Nevertheless, to claim it to be the ""universal law"" is misleading since it depends on the properties of the problem at hand and is not strictly intrinsic to the optimizer. Moreover, for the same (class of) problem the landscape may qualitatively change with increasing N. Rosenbrock function is a good example, it is uni-modal for 2 variables and multi-modal for multiple variables which would affect the halting time distribution. The ""threshold"" dimension value 2 can be turned to 2 billion if needed.",,,
497,True,Learning to superoptimize programs,"Two things I really liked about this paper:
1. The whole idea of having a data-dependent proposal distribution for MCMC. I wasn't familiar with this, although it apparently was previously published. I went back: the (Zhu, 2000) paper was unreadable. The (Jampani, 2014) paper on informed sampling was good. So, perhaps this isn't a good reason for accepting to ICLR.

2. The results are quite impressive. The rough rule-of-thumb is that optimization can help you speed up code by 10%. The standard MCMC results presented on the paper on randomly-generated programs roughly matches this (15%). The fact that the proposed algorithm get ~33% speedup is quite surprising, and worth publishing.

The argument against accepting this paper is that it doesn't match the goals of ICLR. I don't go to ICLR to hear about generic machine learning papers (we have NIPS and ICML for that). Instead, I go to learn about how to automatically represent data and models. Now, maybe this paper talks about how to represent (generated) programs, so it tangentially lives under the umbrella of ICLR. But it will compete against more relevant papers in the conference -- it may just be a poster. Sending this to a programming language conference may have more eventual impact.

Nonetheless, I give this paper an ""accept"", because I learned something valuable and the results are very good.",,7.0,4.0
498,True,Learning to superoptimize programs,"This work builds on top of STOKE (Schkufza et al., 2013), which is a superoptimization engine for program binaries. It works by starting with an existing program, and proposing modifications to it according to a proposal distribution. Proposals are accepted according to the Metropolis-Hastings criteria. The acceptance criteria takes into account the correctness of the program, and performance of the new program. Thus, the MCMC process is likely to converge to correct programs with high performance. Typically, the proposal distribution is fixed. The contribution of this work is to learn the proposal distribution as a function of the features of the program (bag of words of all the opcodes in the program). The experiments compare with the baselines of uniform proposal distribution, and a baseline where one just learns the weights of the proposal distribution but without conditioning on the features of the program. The evaluation shows that the proposed method has slightly better performance than the compared baselines.

The significance of this work at ICLR seems to be quite low., both because this is not a progress in learning representations, but a straightforward application of neural networks and REINFORCE to yet another task which has non-differentiable components. The task itself (superoptimization) is not of significant interest to ICLR readers/attendees. A conference like AAAI/UAI seem a better fit for this work.

The proposed method is seemingly novel. Typical MCMC-based synthesis methods are lacking due to their being no learning components in them. However, to make this work compelling, the authors should consider demonstrating the proposed method in other synthesis tasks, or even more generally, other tasks where MH-MCMC is used, and a learnt proposal distribution can be beneficial. Superoptimization alone (esp with small improvements over baselines) is not compelling enough.

It is also not clear if there is any significant representation learning is going on. Since a BoW feature is used to represent the programs, the neural network cannot possibly learn anything more than just correlations between presence of opcodes and good moves. Such a model cannot possibly understand the program semantics in any way. It would have been a more interesting contribution if the authors had used a model (such as Tree-LSTM) which attempts to learn the semantics the program. The quite naive method of learning makes this paper not a favorable candidate for acceptance.",,6.0,5.0

The writing is clear and results highlight the efficacy of the method.

comments / questions:
- Am I correct in understanding that of the entire stochastic computation graph, only the features->proposal part is learned. The rest is still effectively the stoke MCMC scheme? Does that imply that the 'uniform' model is effectively Stoke and is your baseline (this should probably be made explicit )

- Did the authors consider learning the features instead of using out of the box features (could be difficult given the relatively small amount of data - the feature extractor might not generalize).

- In a different context, 'Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Variational Inference:Bridging the Gap' by Salimans et al. suggests considering a MCMC scheme as a stochastic computation graph and optimizing using a variational (i.e. RL) criterion. The problem is different, it uses HMC instead of MCMC, but it might be worth citing as a similar approach to 'meta-optimized' MCMC algorithms.

A simpler architecture that removes the first LSTM and uses the output of the second LSTM as the global context vector is also proposed (SS-ATT). 
Experiments on three datasets are presented, however the results are mostly not state-of-the-art.

Why is your Yelp 2013 dataset smaller than the original Tang et al, 2015 paper that has ~300k documents?

However, the technical increment over the NIPS 16 paper: “Measuring the reliability of MCMC inference with bidirectional Monte Carlo” is very small, or nonexistent (but please correct me if I am wrong!).  (Grosse et al). The relative contribution of this paper is the application of this method to generative models. 
In section 2.3 the authors seem to make a mistake. They write E[p’(x)] <= p(x) but I think they mean: E[log p’(x)] <= log E[p’(x)] = log p(x). Also,  for what value of x? If p(x) is normalized it can’t be true for all values of x. Anyways, I think there are typos here and there and the equations could be more precise.
On page 5 top of the page it is said that the AIS procedure can be initialized with q(z|x) instead of p(z). However, it is unclear what value of x is then picked? Is it perhaps Ep(x)[q(z|x)] ?

On the one hand I think it does a really nice job at providing a simple method to evaluate mode dropping and overfitting in generative models, which is one of the most important problems in machine learning now. I can see myself and many more people using these ideas to evaluate aspects of generative models

On the other hand, there is a constant use of the term ""log-likelihood for GANs"", which is extremely misleading. The log-likelihood of GANs is obviously ill-defined, and the assumption of ""Gaussian observation"" is incredibly false, since the true after-sampling variance that GANs are trained on is 0. You should relate how the model with noise added relates to properties on the actual distribution induced by the generator with no gaussian noise, instead of assuming the generator has Gaussian noise in the end, which is obviously false for a GAN and true for a VAE (which is trained this way since the reconstruction error assumes this kind of noise). I'm not asking for a precise mathematical statement of this relation, but I do think the writing sweeps this issue under the carpet, and the addition of isotropic noise on a distribution with an incredibly complex covariance matrix is more than questionable.

As a final note, I think section 2.2 which describes the central algorithm is very poorly written. After reading the section several times I have no idea how to implement it or how the sampling process is defined in the end. In my opinion, you should try to describe better:

- Which is the sampling distribution of the estimate of p(x) at time t. I believe this is p(x) = E_{z ~ p_t(z)} [ p(x | z) p(z) / p_t(z) ] but I'm far from sure.
- Explain why the successive estimator's are unbiased (if it's in the above form this is trivial)
- Explain why the estimators have less variance as t -> T.
- Explain what the theoretical guarantees of AIS are.

504,True,On the Quantitative Analysis of Decoder-Based Generative Models,"# Review
This paper proposes a quantitative evaluation for decoder-based generative models that use Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) to estimate log-likelihoods. Quantitative evaluations are indeed much needed since for some models, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMNs), qualitative evaluation of samples is still frequently used to assess their generative capability. Even though, there exist quantitative evaluations like Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), the authors show how AIS is more accurate than KDE and how it can be used to perform fine-grained comparison between generative models (GAN, GMMs and Variational Autoencoders (VAE)).

The authors report empirical results comparing two different decoder architectures that were both trained, on the continuous MNIST dataset, using the VAE, GAN and GMMN objectives. They also trained an Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) on binarized MNIST and show that, in this case, the IWAE bound underestimates the true log-likelihoods by at least 1 nat (which is significant for this dataset) according to the AIS evaluation of the same model.


# Pros
Their evaluation framework is public and is definitely a nice contribution to the community.

This paper gives some insights about how GAN behaves from log-likelihood perspective. The authors disconfirm the commonly proposed hypothesis that GAN are memorizing training data. The authors also observed that GANs miss important modes of the data distribution.


# Cons/Questions
It is not clear for me why sometimes the experiments were done using different number of examples (100, 1000, 10000) coming from different sources (trainset, validset, testset or simulation/generated by the model). For instance, in Table 2 why results were not reported using all 10,000 examples of the testing set?

It is not clear why in Figure 2c, AIS is slower than AIS+encoder? Is the number of intermediate distributions the same in both?

16 independent chains for AIS seems a bit low from what I saw in the literature (e.g. in [Salakhutdinov & Murray, 2008] or [Desjardins etal., 2011], they used 100 chains). Could it be that increasing the number of chains helps tighten the confidence interval reported in Table 2?

I would have like the authors to give their intuitions as to why GAN50 has a BDMC gap of 10 nats, i.e. 1 order of magnitude compared to the others?

Figure 2(a), are the reported values represents the average log-likelihood of 100 (each or total?) training and validation examples of MNIST (as described in Section 5.3.2).
Figure 2(c), I'm guessing it is on binarized MNIST? Also, why are there fewer points for AIS compared to IWAE and AIS+encoder?
Are the BDMC gaps mentioned in Section 5.3.1 the same as the ones reported in Table2 ?

505,True,On the Quantitative Analysis of Decoder-Based Generative Models,"Summary:
This paper describes how to estimate log-likelihoods of currently popular decoder-based generative models using annealed importance sampling (AIS) and HMC. It validates the method using bidirectional Monte Carlo on the example of MNIST, and compares the performance of GANs and VAEs.


Review:
Although this seems like a fairly straight-forward application of AIS to me (correct me if I missed an important trick to make this work), I very much appreciate the educational value and empirical contributions of this paper. It should lead to clarity in debates around the density estimation performance of GANs, and should enable more people to use AIS.

Space permitting, it might be a good idea to try to expand the description of AIS. All the components of AIS are mentioned and a basic description of the algorithm is given, but the paper doesn’t explain well “why” the algorithm does what it does/why it works.

I was initially confused by the widely different numbers in Figure 2. On first glance my expectation was that this Figure is comparing GAN, GMMN and IWAE (because of the labeling at the bottom and because of the leading words in the caption’s descriptions). Perhaps mention in the caption that (a) and (b) use continuous MNIST and (c) uses discrete MNIST. “GMMN-50” should probably be “GMMN-10”.


Using reconstructions for evaluation of models may be a necessary but is not sufficient condition for a good model. Depending on the likelihood, a posterior sample might have very low density under the prior, for example. It would be great if the authors could point out and discuss the limitations of this test a bit more.


Minor:

Perhaps add a reference to MacKay’s density networks (MacKay, 1995) for decoder-based generative models.

In Section 2.2, the authors write “the prior over z can be drastically different than the true posterior p(z|x), especially in high dimension”. I think the flow of the paper could be improved here, especially for people less familiar with importance sampling/AIS. I don’t think the relevance of the posterior for importance sampling is clear at this point in the paper.

In Section 2.3 the authors claim that is often more “meaningful” to estimate p(x) in log-space because of underflow problems. “Meaningful” seems like the wrong word here. Perhaps revise to say that it’s more practical to estimate log p(x) because of underflow problems, or to say that it’s more meaningful to estimate log p(x) because of its connection to compression/surprise/entropy.",,7.0,4.0

507,True,Incorporating long-range consistency in CNN-based texture generation,"The paper introduces a variation to the CNN-based texture synthesis procedure of Gatys et al. that matches correlations between spatially shifted feature responses in addition to the correlations between feature responses at the same position in the feature maps.

Additionally, the procedure proposed is very costly which makes an already slow texture synthesis method substantially slower. For example, in comparison, the concurrent work by Liu et al.

508,True,Incorporating long-range consistency in CNN-based texture generation,"The paper investigates a simple extension of Gatys et al. CNN-based texture descriptors for image generation. Similar to Gatys et al., the method uses as texture descriptor the empirical intra-channel correlation matrix of the CNN feature response at some layer of a deep network. Differently from Gatys et al., longer range correlations are measured by introducing a shift between the correlated feature responses, which translates in a simple modification of the original architecture.

The idea is simple but has interesting effects on the generated textures and can be extended to transformations other than translation. While longer range correlations could be accounted for by considering the response of deeper CNN features in the original method by Gatys et al., the authors show that modelling them explicitly using shallower features is more effective, which is reasonable.

An important limitation that this work shares with most of its peers is the lack of a principled quantitative evaluation protocol, such that judging the effectiveness of the approach remains almost entirely a qualitative affair. While this should not be considered a significant drawback of the paper due to the objective difficulty of solving this open issue, nevertheless it is somewhat limiting that no principled evaluation method could be devised and implemented. The authors suggest that, as future work, a possible evaluation method could be based on a classification task -- this is a potentially interesting approach that merits some further investigation.

509,True,Incorporating long-range consistency in CNN-based texture generation,"This paper proposes a modification of the parametric texture synthesis model of Gatys et al. to take into account long-range correlations of textures. To this end the authors add the Gram matrices between spatially shifted feature vectors to the synthesis loss. Some of the synthesised textures are visually superior to the original Gatys et al. method, in particular on textures with very structured long-range correlations (such as bricks).

The paper is well written, the method and intuitions are clearly exposed and the authors perform quite a wide range of synthesis experiments on different textures.

My only concern, which is true for all methods including Gatys et al., is the variability of the samples. Clearly the global minimum of the proposed objective is the original image itself. This issue is partially circumvented by performing inpainting experiments, by which the synthesised paths needs to stay coherent with the borders (as the authors did). There are no additional insights into this problem in this paper, which would have been a plus.

All in all, this work is a simple and nice modification of Gatys at al. which is worth publishing but does not constitute a major breakthrough.

Also what’s the rationale for using tanh nonlinearity (over, say RELU), is it somehow experimentally optimised choice?

I would find interesting a discussion on a possibility of handling missing data in case one or more modalities are unavailable at test time. Is this possible in the current model to back-off to fewer modalities? Synthetic example may suggest that’s in fact possible. Those numbers, perhaps, could be added to table 2.

In the synthetic experiment, you should compare MGU with the fully-connected MLP model really, with similar complexity - that is - at least two hidden units (as GMU has two such for each modality) followed by logistic regression. At least in terms of capability of drawing decision boundary, those should be comparable.

I think, broader discussion shall be written on the related work associated with mixture of experts models (which is fact are very similar conceptually) as well as multiplicative RNN models [1].

GMUs are related to ""mixture of experts"" in that different examples will be classified by different parts of the model, (but rather than routing/gating entire examples, individual hidden units are gated separately).  They are related to attention models in that different parts of the input are weighted differently; there the emphasis is on gating modalities of input.

So it is quite straightforward that the paper should test the algorithm in other applications, which was not done yet. That is the biggest shortcoming of this paper in my opinions.  

Another concern lies in how to evaluate the performance of information fusion. The abstract claims ""The model improves the macro f-score performance of single-modality models by 30% and 4% with respect to visual and textual information respectively"", however, such an improvement is off the key. If two modals are complementary to each other, the fusion results will always be higher. The key fact is how much better than baselines the proposed GMU is.

515,True,Adversarially Learned Inference,"After reading the rebuttal, I decided to increase my score. I think ALI somehow stabilizes the GAN training as demonstrated in Fig. 8 and learns a reasonable inference network.

---------------
Initial Review:

This paper proposes a new method for learning an inference network in the GAN framework. ALI's objective is to match the joint distribution of hidden and visible units imposed by an encoder and decoder network. ALI is trained on multiple datasets, and it seems to have a good reconstruction even though it does not have an explicit reconstruction term in the cost function. This shows it is learning a decent inference network for GAN.

There are currently many ways to learn an inference network for GANs: One can learn an inference network after training the GAN by sampling from the GAN and learning a separate network to map X to Z. There is also the infoGAN approach (not cited) which trains the inference network at the same time with the generative path. I think this paper should have an extensive comparison with these other methods and have a discussion for why ALI's inference network is superior to previous works.

Since ALI's inference network is stochastic, it would be great if different reconstructions of a same image is included. I believe the inference network of the BiGAN paper is deterministic which is the main difference with this work. So maybe it is worth highlighting this difference.

The quality of samples is very good, but there is no quantitative experiment to compare ALI's samples with other GAN variants. So I am not sure if learning an inference network has contributed to better generative samples. Maybe including an inception score for comparison can help.

There are two sets of semi-supervised results: 
The first one concatenate the hidden layers of the inference network and uses an L2-SVM afterwards. Ideally, concatenating feature maps is not the best way for semi-supervised learning and one would want to train the semi-supervised path at the same time with the generative path. It would have been much more interesting if part of the hidden code was a categorical distribution and another part of it was a continuous distribution like Gaussian, and the inference network on the categorical latent variable was used directly for classification (like semi-supervised VAE). In this case, the inference network would be trained at the same time with the generative path. Also if the authors can show that ALI can disentangle factors of variations with a discrete latent variable like infoGAN, it will significantly improve the quality of the paper.

The second semi-supervised learning results show that ALI can match the state-of-the-art. But my impression is that the significant gain is mainly coming from the adaptation of Salimans et al. (2016) in which the discriminator is used for classification. It is unclear to me why learning an inference network help the discriminator do a better job in classification. How do we know the proposed method is improving the stability of the GAN? My understanding is that one of the main points of learning an inference network is to learn a mapping from the image to the high-level features such as class labels. So it would have been more interesting if the inference path was directly used for semi-supervised learning as I explained above.",,7.0,4.0
516,True,Adversarially Learned Inference,"This paper extends the GAN framework to allow for latent variables. The observed data set is expanded by drawing latent variables z from a conditional distribution q(z|x). The joint distribution on x,z is then modeled using a joint generator model p(x,z)=p(z)p(x|z).  Both q and p are then trained by trying to fool a discriminator. This constitutes a worthwhile extension of GANs: giving GANs the ability to do inference opens up many applications that could previously only be addressed by e.g. VAEs.

The results are very promising. The CIFAR-10 samples are the best I've seen so far (not counting methods that use class labels).

518,False,Efficient Communications in Training Large Scale Neural Networks,"The primary point made by this paper is that given certain architectural characteristics of multi-GPU systems, namely the use of bi-directional PCI-E for communication and the integration of two independent DMA engines on recent GPU devices (providing support for simultaneous independent communications), and given the characteristics of the communications patterns required by synchronous SGD trainers for deep neural networks, namely that the messages are large, dense, and have a fixed length, it makes sense to design communication collectives such as broadcast, reduce, and allreduce specifically for the use case of synchronous SGD training on a multi-GPU system.  The paper describes the implementation of these three collectives (broadcast, reduce, and allreduce) using a linear pipelining (LP) scheme on a (logical) ring topology.  The paper compares the LP collectives to two alternatives:  collectives based on a minimal spanning tree (MST) topology and collectives based on bidirectional exchange (BE).  First, a theoretical comparison is made using a standard cost model used in the high performance computing community.  When assumptions based on multi-GPU system architecture (very low latency for messages) and on the communication characteristics of synchronous SGD training (very large messages) are integrated into the model, the paper finds that the LP collectives should be less costly than BE collectives by a factor of 2 and less costly than MST collectives by a factor of log(p), where p is the number of GPUs being used.  Second, an empirical comparison is performed in which (1) the time required to perform each of the different collectives on a 4-device (k40m) system is measured as a function of message size and (2) the time required to perform each of the different collectives with a 200 MB message length is measured as a function of the number of devices in the system.  These measurements show that the LP-based collectives are consistently the fastest.  Third, DNN training experiments with AlexNet and GoogLeNet are performed on a 4-device system using three different synchronous SGD algorithms with the different implementations of the collectives (a total of 6 different algorithms in all).  Measurements of the communication and computation costs show that the LP collectives reduce communication costs without affecting computation costs (as expected).  Measurements of the convergence of the training loss as a function of time for the two DNN architectures show that use of the LP collectives leads to faster training.

While the theory says that the costs of LP collectives should be invariant to the number of devices in a multi-GPU system, the empirical work shows that in practice this does not hold going from 4 to 5 devices (in the tested configuration) because in a 5-device system messages must traverse the QPI.  Are there other practical considerations that the authors are aware of that affect the scaling of the LP collectives?  If so, these should be mentioned in the paper.

In the sentence ""Worringen (2003) proposed a pipeline collective model in shared memory environment for CPU data, but communications of different MPI processes sharing the same CPU memory bus within the same CPU socket."" I really can't figure out what the words after ""but communications of different MPI processes"" are trying to convey.  This sentence is not comprehensible.

""Please note the latency term is log pα, which is the smallest among algorithms in Table.1. Therefore, MST only suits for high frequent short messages.""  The claim that MST collectives are only suitable for high-frequency, short messages does not follow from the statement that MST collectives have the smallest latency term.  You also need to consider the way the cost scales with message size (the bandwidth term).  If the MST collectives had a better bandwidth term than the other collectives, then they would also be superior for large messages.

""Let’s take an appropriate block size b to ensure n/b ≪ α.""  This looks wrong, since n > b.  Should it be b/n ≪ α?

""However, the parameters are not consistent after several iterations due to the precision issues of float multiplications in Gradient Update.""  Are you sure the inconsistency in weight estimates across devices is due to multiplication?  I would expect that it would be due to gradients being accumulated in different orders; that is, because floating point addition is not commutative.

This does not provide an upper-bound of T_broadcase_LP and it can be arbitrary worse when comparing with T_broadcase_BE from this inequality. Therefore, instead of showing T_broadcase_BE/ T_broadcase_LP < 2, the authors should state T_broadcase_BE/ T_broadcase_LP > 1 when n approaches infinity.

Comments
1) The name linear pipeline is somewhat confusing to the readers, as the technique is usually referred as ring based approach in Allreduce literature. The author should use the standard name to make the connection easier. 
2) The cost analysis of ring-based Allreduce is already provided in the existing literature. This paper applied the analysis to the case of multi-GPU deep net training, and concluded that the scaling is invariant of number of GPUs.
3) The ring-based allreduce approach is already supported by NVidia’s NCCL library, although the authors claim that their implementation comes earlier than the NCCL implementation.
4) The overlap of communication of computation is an already applied technique in systems such as TensorFlow and MXNet. The schedule proposed by the authors exploits the overlap partially, doing backprop of t-1 while doing reduce.  Note that the dependency pattern can be further exploited; with the forward of layer t depend on update of parameter of layer t in last iteration. This can be done by a dependency scheduler.	
5) Since this paper is about analysis of Allreduce, it would be nice to include detailed analysis of tree-shape reduction, ring-based approach and all-to-all approach. The discussion of all-to-all approach is missing in the current paper. 
In summary, this is a paper discussed existing Allreduce techniques for data parallel multi-GPU training of deep net, with cost analysis based on existing results. While I personally find the claimed result not surprising as it follows from existing analysis of Allreduce, the analysis might help some other readers. I view this as a baseline paper. The analysis of Allreduce could also been improved (see comment 5).

526,True,Revisiting Classifier Two-Sample Tests,"## Paper summary

The paper reconsiders the idea of using a binary classifier to do two-sample testing. The idea is to split the sample into two disjoint training and test sets, train a classifier on the training set, and use the accuracy on the test set as the test statistic. If the accuracy is above chance level, one concludes that the two samples are from different distributions i.e., reject H0.

A theoretical result on an asymptotic approximate test power is provided. One implication is that the test is consistent, assuming that the classifier is better than coin tossing. Experiments on toy problems, evaluation of GANs, and causal discovery verify the effectiveness of the test. In addition, when the classifier is a neural net, examining the first linear filter layer allows one to see features which are most activated. The result is an interpretable visual indicator of how the two samples differ.

## Review summary 

The paper is well written and easy to follow. The idea of using a binary classifier for a two-sample testing is not new, as made clear in the paper. The main contributions are the analysis of the asymptotic test power, the use of modern deep nets as the classifier in this context, and the empirical studies on various tasks. The empirical results are satisfactorily convincing.  Although not much discussion is made on why the method works well in practice, overall contributions have a potential to start a new direction of research on model criticisms of generative models, as well as visualization of where a model fails. I vote for an acceptance.

## Major comments / questions 

My main concern is on Theorem 1 (asymptotic test power) and its assumptions.  But, I understand that these can be fixed as discussed below.

* Under H0, the distribution of the test statistic (i.e., sum of 0-1 classification results) follows Binomial(nte, 1/2) as stated.  However, under H1, terms in the sum are independent but *not* identical Bernoulli random variable. This is because each term depends on a data point z_i, which can be from either P or Q. So, in the paragraph in Sec3.1: ""... the random variable n_te \hat{t} follows a Binomial(nte, p)..."" is not correct. Essentially p depends on z_i. It should follow a Poisson binomial distribution.

* In the same paragraph, for the same reason, the alternative distribution of Binomial(nte, p=p_{risk}) is probably not correct. I guess you mention it to use Moivre-Laplace to get the asymptotic normality. 

Anyway, I see no reason why you would need this statement as the Binomial is not required in the proof, but only its asymptotic normality. A variant of the central limit theorem (instead of the Moivre-Laplace theorem) for independent, non-identical variables would still allow you to conclude the asymptotic normality of the Poisson binomial (with some conditions).

the fact that its performances are reported.

528,True,Revisiting Classifier Two-Sample Tests,"The submission considers the setting of 2-sample testing from the perspective of evaluating a classifier.  For a classifier between two samples from the same distribution, the distribution of the classification accuracy follows a simple form under the null hypothesis.  As such, a straightforward threshold can be derived for any classifier.  Finding a more powerful test then amounts to training a better classifier.  One may then focus efforts, e.g. on deep neural networks, for which statistics such as the MMD may be very difficult to characterize.

+ The approach is sound and very general
+ The paper is timely in that deep learning has had huge impacts in classification and other prediction settings, but has not had as big an impact on statistical hypothesis testing as kernel methods have

- The discussion of the relationship to kernel-MMD has not always been as realistic as it could have been.  For example, the kernel-MMD can also be seen as a classifier based approach, so a more fair discussion could be provided.  Also, the form of kernel-MMD used in the comparisons is a bit contradictory to the discussion as well
 * The linear kernel-MMD is used which is less powerful than the quadradic kernel-MMD (the authors have justified this from the perspective of computation time)
 * The kernel-MMD is argued against due to its unwieldy distribution under the null, but the linear time kernel-MMD (see also Zaremba et al., NIPS 2013) has a Gaussian distribution under the null.

530,True,Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching,"The authors present a way to complement the Gerative Adversarial Network traning procedure with an additional term based on denoising autoencoders. The use of denoising autoencoders is motivated by the observation that they implicitly capture the distribution of the data they were trained on. While sampling methods based denoising autoencoders alone don't amount to very interesting generative models (at least no-one could demonstrate otherwise), this paper shows that it can be combined successfully with generative adversarial networks.

My overall assessment of this paper is that it is well written, well reasoned, and presents a good idea motivated from first principles. I feel that the idea presented here is not revolutionary or a very radical departure from what has been done before, I would have liked a slightly more structured experiments section which focusses on and provides insights into the relative merits of different choices one could make (see pre-review questions for details), rather than focussing just on demonstrating that a chosen variant works.

In addition to this general review, I have already posted specific questions and criticism in the pre-review questions - thanks for the authors' responses. Based on those responses the area I am most uncomfortable about is whether the (Alain & Bengio, 2014) intuition about the denoising autoencoders is valid if it all happens in a nonlinear featurespace. If the denoiser function's behaviour ends up depending on the Jacobian of the nonlinear transformation Phi, another question is whether this dependence is exploitable by the optimization scheme.",,7.0,5.0

533,True,Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching,"This paper is about using denoising autoencoders to improve performance in GANs. In particular, the features as determined by the discriminator, of images generated by the generator, are fed into a denoising AE and we try to have these be reconstructed well. I think it's an interesting idea to use this ""extra information"" -- namely the feature representations learned by the discriminator. It seems very much in the spirit of ICLR! My main concern, though, is that I'm not wholly convinced on the nature of the improvement. This method achieves higher inception scores than other methods in some cases, but I have a hard time interpreting these scores and thus a hard time getting excited by the results. In particular, the authors have not convinced me that the benefits outweigh the required additional sophistication both conceptually and implementation-wise (speaking of which, will code be released?). One thing I'd be curious to know is, how hard is it to get this thing to actually work? 

Also, I view GANs as a means to an end -- while I'm not particularly excited about generating realistic images (especially in 32x32), I'm very excited about the future potential of GAN-based systems. So it would have been nice to see these improvements in inception score translate into improvements in a more useful task. But this criticism could probably apply to many GAN papers and so perhaps isn't fair here.

The experiments are solid, comprehensive and very useful in practical terms.  It is good to see that the best vocabulary selection method is very effective at achieving a very high proportion of the coverage of the full-vocabulary model (fig 3).  However, I feel that the experiments in section 4.3 (vocabulary selection during training) was rather limited in their scope - I would have liked to see more experiments here.

537,False,Vocabulary Selection Strategies for Neural Machine Translation,"This paper compares several strategies for guessing a short list of vocabulary for the target language in neural machine translation. The primary findings are that word alignment dictionaries work better than a variety of other techniques.

My take on this paper is that to have a significant impact, it needs to make the case for why one might want vocabulary rather than characters or sub word units like BPE. I think there are likely many very good reasons to do this that could be argued for (synthesize morphology, deal with transliteration, etc), but most of these would suggest some particular models and experiments, which are of course not in this paper. As it is, I think this paper is a useful but minor contribution that shows that word alignment is a good way of getting short lists, but it does not strongly make the case that we should abandon work in other directions.

Minor comments:
In addition to the SVM approach for modeling vocabulary, the discriminative word lexicon of Mauser et al. (2009) and the neural version of Ha et al. (2014) are also worth mentioning.

It would be useful to know what the coverage rate of the actual full vocabulary would be (rather than the 100k “full vocabulary”). Since presumably this technique could be used to work with much larger vocabularies.

When reducing the vocabulary size for training, the Mi et al. (2016) technique of taking the union of all the vocabularies in a mini batch seems like a rather strange objective. If the vocabulary of a single sentence is used, the probabilistic semantics of the translation model can still be preserved since p(e | f, vocab(f)) = p(e | f) if p(vocab(f) | f) = 1, i.e., is deterministic, which it is here. Whereas the objective is no longer a sensible probability model in the mini batch vocabulary case. Thus, while it may be a bit more difficult to implement, it seems like it would at least be a sensible comparison to make.",,4.0,5.0

The approach is illustrated in two tasks: gridworld with objects and a simplified Minecraft problem).  The idea of providing symbolic descriptions of tasks and learning corresponding ""implementations"" is potentially interesting and the empirical results are promising.  However, there are two main drawbacks of the current incarnation of this work.  First, the ideas presented in the paper have all been explored in other work (symbolic specifications, actor-critic, shared representations).  While related work is discussed, it is not really clear what is new here, and what is the main contribution of this work besides providing a new implementation of existing ideas in the context of deep learning. The main contribution if the work needs to be clearly spelled out.  Secondly, the approach presented relies crucially on curriculum learning (this is quite clear from the experiments).  While the authors argue that specifying tasks in simplified language is easy, designing a curriculum may in fact be pretty complicated, depending on the task at hand.  The examples provided are fairly small, and there is no hint of how curriculum can be designed for larger problems. Because the approach is sensitive to the curriculum, this limits the potential utility of the work. It is also unclear if there is a way to provide supervision automatically, instead of doing it based on prior domain knowledge.
More minor comments:
- The experiments are not described in enough detail in the paper. It's great to provide github code, but one needs to explain in the paper why certain choices were made in the task setup (were these optimized? What's this the first thing that worked?) Even with the code, the experiments as described are not reproducible
- The description of the approach is pretty tangled with the specific algorithmic choices. Can the authors step back and think more generally of how this approach can be formalized?  I think this would help relate it to the prior work more clearly as well.",,4.0,5.0
540,False,Modular Multitask Reinforcement Learning with Policy Sketches,"This paper studies the problem of abstract hierarchical multiagent RL with policy sketches, high level descriptions of abstract actions. The work is related to much previous work in hierarchical RL, and adds some new elements by using neural implementations of prior work on hierarchical learning and skill representations. 

Sketches are sequences of high level symbolic labels drawn from some fixed vocabulary, which initially are devoid of any meaning. Eventually the sketches get mapped into real policies and enable policy transfer and temporal abstraction. Learning occurs through a variant of the standard actor critic architecture. 

Experiments are provided through a standard game like domain (maze, minecraft etc.). 

The paper as written suffers from two problems. One, the idea of policy sketches is nice, but not sufficiently fleshed out to have any real impact. It would have been useful to see this spelled out in the context of abstract SMDP models to see what they bring to the table. What one gets here is some specialized invocation of this idea in the context of the specific approach proposed here. Second, the experiments are not thorough enough in terms of comparing with all the related work. For example, Ghavamzadeh et al. explored the use of MAXQ like abstractions in the context of mulitagent RL. It would be great to get a more detailed comparison to MAXQ based multiagent RL approaches, where the value function is explicitly decomposed. ",,5.0,5.0

The model relies on a hierarchical structure where the sub-policy is chosen depending on the current operation to execute in the sketch . The learning algorithm is based on an extension of the actor-critic model for that particular case, and also involves curriculum learning techniques when the task to solve is hard. Experimental results are provided on different learning problems and compared to baseline methods. 

The paper is well-written and very easy to follow. I am not really convinced by the impact of such a paper since the problem solved here can be seen as an option-learning problem with a richer supervision (i.e the sequence of option is given). It thus corresponds to an easier problem with a limited impact. Moreover, I do not really understand to which concrete application this setting corresponds. For example, learning from natural langage instructions is clearly more relevant. So since the model proposed in this article is not a major contribution and shares many common ideas with existing hierarchical reinforcement learning methods,  the paper lacks a strong motivation and/or concrete application. So, the paper only has a marginal interest for the RL community

Although not treated as such, the experimental setup is reminiscent of hierarchical RL works, an aspect which the paper does not consider at length, regrettably.
One possible implication of this work is that architecture and even learning algorithm choices could simply be stated in terms of the objective of the target task, rather than being hand-engineered by the experimenter. This is clearly an interesting direction of future work which the paper illuminates.


Pros:
The paper diligently explains how the network architecture fits in with various widely used reinforcement learning setups, which does facilitate continuation of this work.
The experiments are good proofs of concept, but do not go beyond that i.m.h.o. 
Even so, this work provides convincing clues that collections of deep networks, which were trained on not entirely different tasks, generalize better to related tasks when used together rather than through conventional transfer learning (e.g. fine-tuning).

Cons:
As the paper well recounts in the related work section, libraries of fixed policies have long been formally proposed for reuse while learning similar tasks. Indeed, it is well understood in hierarchical RL literature that it can be beneficial to reuse libraries of fixed (Fernandez & Veloso 2006) or jointly learned policies which may not apply to the entire state space, e.g. options (Pricop et. al). What is not well understood is how to build such libraries, and this paper does not convincingly shed light in that direction, as far as I can tell.
The transfer tasks have been picked to effectively illustrate the potential of the proposed architecture, but the paper does not tackle negative transfer or compositional reuse in well known challenging situations outlined in previous work (e.g. Parisotto et. al 2015, Rusu el. al 2015, 2016).
Since the main contributions are of an empirical nature, I am curious how the results shown in figures 6 & 7 look plotted against wall-clock time, since relatively low data efficiency is not a limitation for achieving perfect play in Pong (see Mnih. et al, 2015). It would be more illuminating to consider tasks where final performance is plausibly limited by data availability. It would also be interesting if the presented results were achieved with reduced amounts of computation, or reduced representation sizes compared to learning from scratch, especially when one of the useful source tasks is an actual policy trained on the target task.
Finally, it is perhaps underwhelming that it takes a quarter of the data required for learning Pong from scratch just to figure out that a perfect Pong policy is already in the expert library. Simply evaluating each expert for 10 episodes and using an  average-score-weighted majority vote to mix action choices would probably achieve the same final performance for a smaller fraction of the data.",,7.0,4.0

The method is based on soft attention mechanism, very general, and demonstrated to be applicable in both policy gradient and value iteration methods. The introduction of base network allows learning new policy if the prior policies aren't directly applicable. State-dependent sub policy selection allows finer control and can be thought of assigning state space to different sub policies/experts. The tasks are relatively simplistic but sufficient to demonstrate the benefits. One limitation is that the method is simple and the results/claims are mostly empirical.

546,True,Exploring Sparsity in Recurrent Neural Networks,"The paper proposes a method for pruning weights in neural networks during training to obtain sparse solutions. The approach is applied to an RNN-based system which is trained and evaluated on a speech recognition dataset. The results indicate that large savings in test-time computations can be obtained without affecting the task performance too much. In some cases the method can actually improve the evaluation performance.

The experiments are done using a state-of-the-art RNN system and the methodology of those experiments seems sound. I like that the effect of the pruning is investigated for networks of very large sizes. The computational gains are clearly substantial. It is a bit unfortunate that all experiments are done using a private dataset. Even with private training data, it would have been nice to see an evaluation on a known test set like the HUB5 for conversational speech. It would also have been nice to see a comparison with some other pruning approaches given the similarity of the proposed method to the work by Han et al. [2] to verify the relative merit of the proposed pruning scheme. While single-stage training looks more elegant at first sight, it may not save much time if more experiments are needed to find good hyperparameter settings for the threshold adaptation scheme. Finally, the dense baseline would have been more convincing if it involved some model compression tricks like training on the soft targets provided by a bigger network.

Overall, the paper is easy to read. The table and figure captions could be a bit more detailed but they are still clear enough. The discussion of potential future speed-ups of sparse recurrent neural networks and memory savings is interesting but not specific to the proposed pruning algorithm. The paper doesn’t motivate the details of the method very well. It’s not clear to me why the threshold has to ramp up after a certain period time for example. If this is based on preliminary findings, the paper should mention that.

Sparse neural networks have been the subject of research for a long time and this includes recurrent neural networks (e.g., sparse recurrent weight matrices were standard for echo-state networks [1]). The proposed method is also very similar to the work by Han et al. [2], where a threshold is used to prune weights after training, followed by a retraining phase of the remaining weights. While I think that it is certainly more elegant to replace this three stage procedure with a single training phase, the proposed scheme still contains multiple regimes that resemble such a process by first training without pruning followed by pruning at two different rates and finally training without further pruning again. The main novelty of the work would be the application of such a scheme to RNNs, which are typically more tricky to train than feedforward nets.

Improving scalability is an important driving force of the progress in neural network research. While I don’t think the paper presents much novelty in ideas or scientific insight, it does show that weight pruning can be successfully applied to large practical RNN systems without sacrificing much in performance. The fact that this is possible with such a simple heuristic is a result worth sharing.


Pros:
The proposed method is successful at reducing the number of parameters in RNNs substantially without sacrificing too much in performance.
The experiments are done using a state-of-the-art system for a practical application.

Cons:
The proposed method is very similar to earlier work and barely novel.
There is no comparison with other pruning methods.
The data is private and this prevents others from replicating the results.

This paper has three main contributions.

(2) It provides experimental results on a Baidu-internal task with the Deep Speech 2 network architecture showing that applying the sparsification to a large model can lead to a final, trained model which has better performance and fewer non-zero parameters than a dense baseline model.  (3) It provides results from timing experiments with the cuSPARSE library showing that there is some potential for faster model evaluation with sufficiently sparse models, but that the current cuSPARSE implementation may not be optimal.

550,True,Reinforcement Learning with Unsupervised Auxiliary Tasks,"This work proposes to train RL agents to also perform auxiliary tasks, positing that doing so will help models learn stronger features.
They propose two pseudo-control tasks, control the change in pixel intensity, and control the activation of latent features. They also propose a supervised regression task, predict immediate reward following a sequence of events. The latter is learned offline via a skewed sampling of an experience replay buffer in order to balance seeing reward or not to 1/2 chance.
Such agents perform significantly well on discrete-action-continuous-space RL tasks, and reach baseline performance in 10x less iterations. 

This work contrasts with traditional ""passive"" unsupervised or model-based learning. Instead of forcing the model to learn a potentially useless representation of the input, or to learn the possibly impossible (due to partial observability) task-modelling objective, learning to control local and internal features of the environment complements learning the optimal control policy.

To me the approach is novel and proposes a very interesting alternative to unsupervised learning that takes advantage of the ""possibility"" of control that an agent has over the environment.
The proposed tasks are explained at a rather high level, which is convenient to understand intuition, but I think some lower level of detail might be useful. For example L_PC should be explicitly mentioned, before reaching the appendix. Otherwise this work is clear and easily understandable by readers familiar with Deep RL.
The methodology is sound, on one hand hand the distribution of best hyperparameters might be different for A3C and UNREAL, but also measuring top-3 ensures that, presuming that the both best hyperparameters for A3C and for UNREAL are within the explored intervals, the per-method best hyperparameters are found.
I think one weakness of the paper (or rather, considering the number of things that can fit in a paper, crucially needed future work) is that there is very little experimental analysis of the effect of the auxiliary tasks appart from their (very strong) effect on performance. In the same vein, pixel/feature control seems to have the most impact, in Labyrinth just A3C+PC beats anything else (except UNREAL), I think it would have been worth looking at this, either in isolation or in more depth, measuring more than just performance on RL tasks.",,8.0,4.0

congratulations on this very interesting paper; using auxiliary tasks is a great idea that opens a lot of future research.

From how I understand the paper now, it seems that in practise, the individual loss functions on the right-hand side of equation (2) are updated separately, i.e., during training, you switch between loss functions and this way optimise them ""simultaneously in parallel"" (p.4). Do I understand this correctly? Because then I don't understand how the lambdas come into play; in what way do they influence the learning (or evaluation) of the agent? Do you ever actually look at L_UNREAL, or evaluate how the agent performs on the auxiliary tasks?

Except for the latter, these auxiliary tasks are only used to help shape the features (by sharing the CNN+LSTM feature extraction network). Experiments show the benefits of this approach on Atari and Labyrinth problems, with in particular much better data efficiency than A3C.

The paper is well written, ideas are sound, and results pretty convincing, so to me this is a clear acceptance. At high level I only have few things to say, none being of major concern:
- I believe you should say something about the extra computational cost of optimizing these auxiliary tasks. How much do you lose in terms of training speed? Which are the most costly components?
- If possible, please try to make it clearer in the abstract / intro that the agent is learning different policies for each task. When I read in the abstract that the agent ""also maximises many other pseudo-reward functions simultaneously by reinforcement learning"", my first understanding was that it learned a single policy to optimize all rewards together, and I realized my mistake only when reaching eq. 1.
- The ""feature control"" idea is not validated empirically (the preliminary experiment in Fig. 5 is far from convincing as it only seems to help slightly initially). I like that idea but I am worried by the fact the task is changing during learning, since the extracted features are being modified. There might be stability / convergence issues at play here.
- Since as you mentioned, ""the performance of our agents is still steadily improving"", why not keep them going to see how far they go? (at least the best ones)
- Why aren't the auxiliary tasks weight parameters (the lambda_*) hyperparameters to optimize? Were there any experiments to validate that using 1 was a good choice?
- Please mention the fact that auxiliary tasks are not trained with ""true"" Q-Learning since they are trained off-policy with more than one step of empirical rewards (as discussed in the OpenReview comments)

Minor stuff:
- ""Policy gradient algorithms adjust the policy to maximise the expected reward, L_pi = -..."" => that's actually a loss to be minimized
- In eq. 1 lambda_c should be within the sum
- Just below eq. 1 r_t^(c) should be r_t+k^(c)
- Figure 2 does not seem to be referenced in the text, also Figure 1(d) should be referenced in 3.3
- ""the features discovered in this manner is shared"" => are shared
- The text around eq. 2 refers to the loss L_PC but that term is not defined and is not (explicitly) in eq. 2
- Please explain what ""Clip"" means for dueling networks in the legend of Figure 3
- I would have liked to see more ablated versions on Atari, to see in particular if the same patterns of individual contribution as on Labyrinth were observed
- In the legend of Figure 3 the % mentioned are for Labyrinth, which is not clear from the text.
- In 4.1.2: ""Figure 3 (right) shows..."" => it is actually the top left plot of the figure. Also later ""This is shown in Figure 3 Top"" should be Figure 3 Top Right.
- ""Figure 5 shows the learning curves for the top 5 hyperparameter settings on three Labyrinth navigation levels"" => I think it is referring to the left and middle plots of the figure, so only on two levels (the text above might also need fixing)
- In 4.2: ""The left side shows the average performance curves of the top 5 agents for all three methods the right half shows..."" => missing a comma or something after ""methods""
- Appendix: ""Further details are included in the supplementary materials."" => where are they?
- What is the value of lambda_PC? (=1 I guess?)

In this case, wouldn't an algorithm that simply injects noise into the gradients eventually attain the best result given enough jobs? A more generous interpretation is that the authors reported the top-3 jobs for *entire* training run, but even that seems not particularly sound, since the claim is that the proposed method achieves *faster* learning -- in that case, shouldn't you also factor in the cost of all the other jobs that did not succeed?",,,

Perhaps the choice of \lambda_c in equation 1 in front of the sum is somewhat confusing, because the use of a lower case c seems to suggest that \lambda_c is actually different for each task (although then it should not be in front of the sum).

So wouldn't \lambda_\mathcal{C} be a better name for this parameter or am I misinterpreting things?

Very nice work, with a neat jump in performance! Just had a couple questions:
1. I understand the idea behind 'pixel control' but I don't quite get the motivation behind adding the 'feature control' task. Could you provide some intuition as to why maximizing the hidden unit activations would help learning? Also, from figure 5(c), it looks like this doesn't help much?
2. Have you tried playing with the skewed sampling parameter (0.5)? We had experimented with a very similar scheme, prioritized sampling (Narasimhan et al., 2015), and found that tuning this parameter did give us some gains.

558,True,Stick-Breaking Variational Autoencoders,"The paper attempts to combine Variational Auto-Encoders with the Stick-Breaking process. The motivation is to tackle the component collapsing and have a representation with stochastic dimensionality. To demonstrate the merit of their approach, the authors test this model on MNIST and SVHN in an unsupervised and semi-supervised fashion.
After reading the paper in more detail, I find that the claim that the dimensionality of the latent variable is stochastic does not seem quite correct: all latent variables are ""used"" (which actually enable backpropagation) but the latent variables are parametrized differently (into $\pi$) and the decoding process is altered as to give the impression of sparsity. The way all these latent variables are used does not involve any marginalization but is very similar to the common soft-gating mechanism already used in LSTM or attentional model.
With respect to the Figure 5b showing the decoder input weights: component collapsing probably does not have the same effect as Gaussian prior. $\pi$ is positive therefore having a very small average value might mean that its value is close to zero most of the time, not requiring any update on the weight. For the standard Gaussian prior, component collapsing means having a very noisy input with no signal involved, which forces the decoder to shut down this channel, i.e. have small incoming weights from this collapsed variable.
Adding a histogram of the latent variables in addition to that might help decide if the associated weights are relatively large because they are actually used or if it's because the inputs are zero anyway.
The semi-supervised results are better than a weaker version of the model used in (Kingma et al., 2014), but as to have a fairer comparison, the results should be compared with the M1+M2 model in that paper, even if that requires also using two VAEs.",,4.0,4.0
559,True,Stick-Breaking Variational Autoencoders,"This paper presents an approach which modifies the variational auto-encoder (VAE) framework so as to use stochastic latent dimensionality. This is achieved by using an inherently infinite prior, the stick-breaking process. This is coupled with inference tailored to this model, specifically the Kumaraswamy distribution as an approximate variational posterior. The resulting model is named the SB-VAE which also has a semi-supervised extension, in similar vein to the original VAE paper.

There's a lot of interest in VAEs these days; many lines of work seek to achieve automatic ""black-box"" inference in these models. For example, the authors themselves mention parallel work by Blei's lab (also others) towards this direction. However, there's a lot of merit in investigating more bespoke solutions to new models, which is what the authors are doing in this paper. Indeed, a (useful) side-effect of providing efficient inference for the SB-VAE is drawing attention to the use of the Kumaraswamy distribution which hasn't been popular in ML.

Although the paper is in general well structured, I found it confusing at parts. I think the major source of confusion comes from the fact that the model specification and model inference are discussed in a somehow mixed manner. The pre-review questions clarified most parts.

I have two main concerns regarding the methodology and motivation of this paper. Firstly, conditioning the model directly on the stick-breaking weights seems a little odd. I initially thought that there was some mixture probabilistic model involved, but this is not the case. To be fair, the authors discuss about this issue (which became clearer to me after the pre-review questions), and explain that they're investigating the apparently challenging problem of using a base distribution G_0. The question is whether their relaxation is still useful. From the experiments it seems that the method is at least competitive, so the answer is yes. Hopefully an extension will come in the future, as the authors mention.

The second concern is about the motivation of this method. It seems that the paper fails to clearly explain in a convincing way why it is beneficial to reformulate the VAE as a SB-VAE. I understand that the non-parametric property induced by the prior might result in better capacity control, however I feel that this advantage (and potentially others which are still unclear to me) is not sufficiently explained and demonstrated. Perhaps some comparison with a dropout approach or a more thorough discussion related to dropout would make this clearer.

Overall, I found this to be an interesting paper, it would be a good fit for ICLR.

The background material is explained clearly, as well as the explanation of the priors and posteriors and their DNCP forms. The paper is really well written.

In experiments, they find that stick-breaking priors does not generally improve upon spherically Gaussian priors in the completely unsupervised setting, when measured w.r.t. log-likelihood. The fact that they do report this 'negative' result suggests good scientific taste. In a semi-supervised setting, the results are better.

565,True,Visualizing Deep Neural Network Decisions: Prediction Difference Analysis,"The authors of this work propose an interesting approach to visualizing the predictions made by a deep neural network. The manuscript is well written is provides good insight into the problem. I also appreciate the application to medical images, as simply illustrating the point on ImageNet isn't interesting enough. I do have some questions and comments.
1.  As the authors correctly point out in 3.1, approximating the conditional probability of a feature x_i by the marginal distribution p(x_i) is not realistic. They advocate for translation invariance, i.e. the position of the pixel in the image shouldn't affect the probability, and suggest that the pixels appearance depends on the small neighborhood around it. However, it is well known that global context makes an big impact on the semantics of pixels. In ""Objects in Contexts"", authors show that a given neighborhood of pixels can take different semantic meanings based on the global context in the image. In the context of deep neural networks, works such as ""ParseNet"" also illustrate the importance of global context on the spatial label distribution. This does not necessarily invalidate this approach, but is a significant limitation. It would be great if the authors provided a modification to (4) and empirically verified the change.

2. Figure 7 shows the distribution over top 3 predictions before and after softmax. It is expected that even fairly uniform distributions will transform toward delta functions after softmax normalization. Is there an additional insight here?

4. Finally, in 4.1, the authors state that it takes 30 minutes to analyze a single image with GooLeNet on a GPU? Why is this so computationally expensive? Such complexity seems to make the algorithm impractical and analyzing datasets of statistical relevance seems prohibitive.",,6.0,5.0
566,True,Visualizing Deep Neural Network Decisions: Prediction Difference Analysis,"The paper presents a theoretically well motivated for visualizing what parts of the input feature map are responsible for the output decision. The key insight is that features that maximally change the output and are simultaneously more unpredictable from other features are the most important ones. Most previous work has focused on finding features that maximally change the output without accounting for their predictability from other features. Authors build upon ideas presented in the work of Robnik-Šikonja & Kononenko (2008).

The results indicate that the proposed visualization mechanism based on modeling conditional distribution identifies more salient regions as compared to a mechanism based on modeling marginal distribution. I like that authors have presented visualization results for a single image across multiple networks and multiple classes. There results show that the proposed method indeed picks up on class-discriminative features. Authors have provided a link to visualizations for a random sample of images in a comment – I encourage the authors to include this in the appendix of the paper. 

My one concern with the paper is – Zeiler et al., proposed a visualization method by greying small square regions in the image. This is similar to computing the visualization using the marginal distribution. Authors compute the marginal visualization using 10 samples, however in the limit of infinite samples the image region would be gray. The conditional distribution is computed using a normal distribution that provides some regularization and therefore estimating the conditional and marginal distributions using 10 samples each is not justified. 
I would like to see the comparison when grey image patches (akin to Zeiler et al.) are used for visualization against the approach based on the conditional distribution.

568,False,Generative Adversarial Parallelization,"This paper proposes Generative Adversarial Parallelization (GAP), one schedule to train N Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in parallel. GAP proceeds by shuffling the assignments between the N generators and the N discriminators at play every few epochs. Therefore, GAP forces each generator to compete with multiple discriminators at random. The authors claim that such randomization reduces undesired ""mode collapsing behaviour"", typical of GANs.

I have three concerns with this submission.

1) After training the N GANs for a sufficient amount of time, the authors propose to choose the best generator using the GAM metric. I oppose to this because of two reasons. First, a single GAN will most likely be unable to express the full richness of the true data begin modeled. Said differently, a single generator with limited power will either describe a mode well, or describe many modes poorly. Second, GAM relies on the scores given by the discriminators, which can be ill-posed (focus on artifacts). Since there is There is nothing wrong with mode collapsing when this happens under control. Thus, I believe that a better strategy would be to not choose and combine all generators into a mixture. Of course, this would require a way to decide on mixture weights. This can be done, for instance, using rejection sampling based on discriminator scores.

2) The authors should provide a theoretical (or at least conceptual) comparison to dropout. In essence, this paper has a very similar flavour: every generator is competing against all N discriminators, but at each epoch we drop N-1 for every generator. Related to the previous point, after training dropout keeps all the neurons, effectively approximating a large ensemble of neural networks.

3) The qualitative results are not convincing. Most of the figures show only results about GAP. How do the baseline samples look like? The GAN and LAPGAN papers show very similar samples. On the other hand, I do not find Figures 3 and 4 convincing: for instance, the generator in Figure 3 was most likely under-parametrized.

As a minor comment, I would remove Figure 2. This is because of three reasons: it may be protected by copyright, it occupies a lot of space, and it does not add much value to the explanation. Also, the indices (i_t) are undefined in Algorithm 1.

569,False,Generative Adversarial Parallelization,"This paper proposes an extension of the GAN framework known as GAP whereby multiple generators and discriminators are trained in parallel. The generator/discriminator pairing is shuffled according to a periodic schedule.

Pros:
+ The proposed approach is simple and easy to replicate.

Cons:
- The paper is confusing to read.
- The results are suggestive but do not conclusively show a performance win for GAP.

The main argument of the paper is that GAP leads to improved convergence and improved coverage of modes. The coverage visualizations are suggestive but there still is not enough evidence to conclude that GAP is in fact improving coverage. And for convergence it is difficult to assess the effect of GAP on the basis of learning curves. The proposed GAM-II metric is circular in that model performance depends on the collection of baselines the model is being compared with. Estimating likelihood via AIS seems to be a promising way to evaluate, as does using the Inception score.

Perhaps a more systematic way to determine GAP's effect would be to set up a grid search of hyperparameters and train an equal number of GANs and GAP-GANs for each setting. Then a histogram over final Inception scores or likelihood estimates of the trained models would help to show whether GAP tended to produce better models. Overall the approach seems promising but there are too many open questions regarding the paper in its current form.

570,False,Generative Adversarial Parallelization,"This paper proposes to address the mode collapsing problem of GANs by training a large set of generators and discriminators, pairing them each up with different ones at different times throughout training. The idea here is that no one generator-discriminator pair can be too locked together since they are all being swapped. This idea is nice and is addressing an important issue with GAN training. However, I think the paper is lacking in experimental results. In particular:

- The authors need to do more work to motivate the GAM metric. It is not intuitively obvious to me that the GAM metric is a good way of evaluating the generator networks since it relies on the prediction of the discriminator networks which can fixate on artifacts. Perhaps the authors could explore if the GAM metric correlates with inception scores or human evaluations. Currently the only quantitative evaluation uses this criterion and it really isn't clear it's a relevant quantity to be measuring. 
- Related to the above comment, the authors need to compare more to other methods. Why not evaluate inception scores and compare with previous methods. Similarly, generation quality is not compared with previous methods. It's not obvious that the sample quality is any better with this method. 

And now just repeating questions from pre-review section:
- If, instead of swapping, you were to simply train K GANs on K splits of the data, or K GANs with differing initial conditions (but without swapping) do you see any improvement in results? Similarly, how about if you train larger capacity models with dropout in G and D? Since dropout essentially averages many models it would be interesting to see if the effects are the same.
- In figure 6 it appears that the validation costs remain the same as parallelization increase, but the training cost goes up and that is why the gap is shrinking. Does this really imply better generalization?

571,True,Steerable CNNs,"This paper essentially presents a new inductive bias in the architecture of (convolutional) neural networks (CNN). The mathematical motivations/derivations of the proposed architecture are detailed and rigorous. The proposed architecture promises to produce equivariant representations with steerable features using fewer parameters than traditional CNNs, which is particularly useful in small data regimes. Interesting and novel connections are presented between steerable filters and so called “steerable fibers”. The architecture is strongly inspired by the author’s previous work, as well as that of “capsules” (Hinton, 2011). The proposed architecture is compared on CIFAR10 against state-of-the-art inspired architectures (ResNets), and is shown to be superior particularly in the small data regime. The lack of empirical comparison on large scale dataset, such as ImageNet or COCO makes this largely a theoretical contribution. I would have also liked to see more empirical evaluation of the equivariance properties. It is not intuitively clear exactly why this architecture performs better on CIFAR10 as it is not clear that capturing equivariances helps to classify different instances of object categories.

572,True,Steerable CNNs,"This paper presents a theoretical treatment of transformation groups applied to convnets, and presents some empirical results showing more efficient usage of network parameters.

The basic idea of steerability makes huge sense and seems like a very important idea to develop.  It is also a very old idea in image processing and goes back to Simoncelli, Freeman, Adelson, as well as Perona/Greenspan and others in the early 1990s.  This paper approaches it through a formal treatment of group theory.  But at the end of the day the idea seems pretty simple - the feature representation of a transformed image should be equivalent to a transformed feature representation of the original image.  Given that the authors are limiting their analysis to discrete groups - for example rotations of 0, 90, 180, and 270 deg. - the formalities brought in from the group theoretic analysis seem a bit overkill.  I'm not sure what this buys us in the end.  it seems the real challenge lies in implementing continuous transformations, so if the theory could guide us in that direction it would be immensely helpful.

Also the description of the experiments is fairly opaque.  I would have a hard time replicating what exactly the authors did here in terms of implementing capsules or transformation groups.

573,True,Steerable CNNs,"The authors propose a parameterization of CNNs that guarantees equivariance wrt a large family of geometric transformations.

The mathematical analysis is rigorous and the material is very interesting and novel. The paper overall reads well; there is a real effort to explain the math accessibly, though some small improvements could be made.

The theory is general enough to include continuous transformations, although the experiments are restricted to discrete ones. While this could be seen as a negative point, it is justified by the experiments, which show that this set of transformations is powerful enough to yield very good results on CIFAR.

Another form of intertwiner has been studied recently by Lenc & Vedaldi [1]; they have studied equivariance empirically in CNNs, which offers an orthogonal view.

In addition to the recent references on scale/rotation deep networks suggested below, geometric equivariance has been studied extensively in the 2000's; mentioning at least one work would be appropriate. The one that probably comes closest to the proposed method is the work by Reisert [2], who studied steerable filters for invariance and equivariance, using Lie group theory. The difference, of course, is that the focus at the time was on kernel machines rather than CNNs, but many of the tools and theorems are relatable.


Some of the notation could be simplified, to make the formulas easier to grasp on a first read:

Working over a lattice Z^d is unnecessarily abstract -- since the inputs are always images, Z^2 would make much of the later math easier to parse. Generalization is straightforward, so I don't think the results lose anything by it; and the authors go back to 2D latices later anyway.

It could be more natural to do away with the layer index l which appears throughout the paper, and have notation for current/next layer instead (e.g. pi and pi'; K and D instead of K_{l+1} and K_l).

In any case I leave it up to the authors to decide whether to include these suggestions on notation, but I urge them to consider them (or other ways to unburden notation).

At a high-level the authors seem to propose a generalization of the standard layered neural architecture (of which MLPs are a special case), based on arbitrary nodes which communicate via messages. The paper then goes on to show that their layer-free architecture can perform the same computation as a standard MLP. This logic appears circular. The low level details of the method are also confusing: while the authors seem to be wanting to move away from layers based on matrix-vector products, Algorithm 4 nevertheless resorts to matrix-vector products for the forward and backwards pass.

In other words, the proposed multiagent system can be framed in the artificial neural network with more complicated layer/connectivity structures while considering each neuron as layer.

The paper shows that for a linear residual network any critical point is a global optimum. This problem is non convex it is interesting that this simple re-parametrization leads to such a result. 

 — Non linear Residual Network:

Authors propose a construction that maps the points to their labels via a resnet , using an initial random projection, followed by a residual block that clusters the data based on their label, and a last layer that maps the clusters to the label. 

1- In Eq 3.4  seems the dimensions are not matching q_j in R^k and e_j in R^r. please clarify 

2- The construction seems fine, but what is special about the resnet here in this construction? One can do a similar construction if we did not have the identity? can you discuss this point?
In the linear case it is clear from a spectral point of view how the identity is helping the optimization. Please provide some intuition.  

3-   Existence of a network in the residual  class that overfits does it give us any intuition on why residual network outperform other architectures? What does an existence result of such a network tell us about its representation power ? 
A simple linear model under the assumption that points can not be too close can overfit the data, and get fast convergence rate (see for instance tsybakov noise condition).

-Section 2: Studying the linear networks is interesting by itself. However, it is not clear that how this could translate to any insight about non-linear networks. For example, you have proved that every critical point is global minimum. I think it is helpful to add some discussion about the relationship between linear and non-linear networks.

-Section 3: The construction is interesting but the expressive power of residual network is within a constant factor of general feedforward networks and I don't see why we need a different proof given all the results on finite sample expressivity of feedforward networks.

-Section 4: I like the experiments. The choice of random projection on the top layer is brilliant. However, since you have combined this choice with all-convolutional residual networks, it is hard for the reader to separate the affect of each of them.

585,True,Fine-grained Analysis of Sentence Embeddings Using Auxiliary Prediction Tasks,"This paper presents a set of experiments investigating what kinds of information are captured in common unsupervised approaches to sentence representation learning. The results are non-trivial and somewhat surprising. For example, they show that it is possible to reconstruct word order from bag of words representations, and they show that LSTM sentence autoencoders encode interpretable features even for randomly permuted nonsense sentences.

Effective unsupervised sentence representation learning is an important and largely unsolved problem in NLP, and this kind of work seems like it should be straightforwardly helpful towards that end. In addition, the experimental paradigm presented here is likely more broadly applicable to a range of representation learning systems. Some of the results seem somewhat strange, but I see no major technical concerns, and think that that they are informative. I recommend acceptance.

One minor red flag: 
- The massive drop in CBOW performance in Figures 1b and 4b are not explained, and seem implausible enough to warrant serious further investigation. Can you be absolutely certain that those results would appear with a different codebase and different random seed implementing the same model? Fortunately, this point is largely orthogonal to the major results of the paper.

Two writing comments:
- I agree that the results with word order and CBOW are surprising, but I think it's slightly misleading to say that CBOW is predictive of word order. It doesn't represent word order at all, but it's possible to probabilistically reconstruct word order from the information that it does encode.
- Saying that ""LSTM auto-encoders are more effective at encoding word order than word content"" doesn't really make sense. These two quantities aren't comparable.",,8.0,4.0

The authors present a methodology for analyzing sentence embedding techniques by checking how much the embeddings preserve information about sentence length, word content, and word order. They examine several popular embedding methods including autoencoding LSTMs, averaged word vectors, and skip-thought vectors. The experiments are thorough and provide interesting insights into the representational power of common sentence embedding strategies, such as the fact that word ordering is surprisingly low-entropy conditioned on word content.

Exploring what sort of information is encoded in representation learning methods for NLP is an important and under-researched area. For example, the tide of word-embeddings research was mostly stemmed after a thread of careful experimental results showing most embeddings to be essentially equivalent, culminating in ""Improving Distributional Similarity with Lessons Learned from Word Embeddings"" by Levy, Goldberg, and Dagan. As representation learning becomes even more important in NLP this sort of research will be even more important.

While this paper makes a valuable contribution in setting out and exploring a methodology for evaluating sentence embeddings, the evaluations themselves are quite simple and do not necessarily correlate with real-world desiderata for sentence embeddings (as the authors note in other comments, performance on these tasks is not a normative measure of embedding quality). For example, as the authors note, the ability of the averaged vector to encode sentence length is trivially to be expected given the central limit theorem (or more accurately, concentration inequalities like Hoeffding's inequality).

The word-order experiments were interesting. A relevant citation for this sort of conditional ordering procedure is ""Generating Text with Recurrent Neural Networks"" by Sutskever, Martens, and Hinton, who refer to the conversion of a bag of words into a sentence as ""debagging.""

587,True,Fine-grained Analysis of Sentence Embeddings Using Auxiliary Prediction Tasks,"This paper analyzes various unsupervised sentence embedding approaches by means of a set of auxiliary prediction tasks. By examining how well classifiers can predict word order, word content, and sentence length, the authors aim to assess how much and what type of information is captured by the different embedding models. The main focus is on a comparison between and encoder-decoder model (ED) and a permutation-invariant model, CBOW. (There is also an analysis of skip-thought vectors, but since it was trained on a different corpus it is hard to compare).

There are several interesting and perhaps counter-intuitive results that emerge from this analysis and the authors do a nice job of examining those results and, for the most part, explaining them. However, I found the discussion of the word-order experiment rather unsatisfying. It seems to me that the appropriate question should have been something like, 'How well does model X do compared to the theoretical upper bound which can be deduced from natural language statistics?' This is investigated from one angle in Section 7, but I would have preferred to the effect of natural language statistics discussed up front rather than presented as the explanation to a 'surprising' observation. I had a similar reaction to the word-order experiments.

Most of the interesting results, in my opinion, are about the ED model. It is fascinating that the LSTM encoder does not seem to rely on natural-language ordering statistics -- it seems like doing so should be a big win in terms of per-parameter expressivity. I also think that it's strange that word content accuracy begins to drop for high-dimensional embeddings. I suppose this could be investigated by handicapping the decoder.

588,True,Fine-grained Analysis of Sentence Embeddings Using Auxiliary Prediction Tasks,"We (J. Mu and P. Viswanath) enjoyed the tour-de-force comparison of a vast variety of sentence representation algorithms all in one compact manuscript. Of particular interest to us were the three  ""synthetic"" tasks introduced here:  (a) to what extent the sentence representation encodes its length; (b) to what extent the sentence representation encodes the identities of words within it and (c) to what extent the sentence representation encodes word order.  

The best part of these tasks is that they are very well defined and labeling does not need any (expert) supervision at all and can be done over the entire corpus too. We have a reasonable intuition on why tasks (a) and (b) might be interesting/relevant for downstream tasks: the length of a sentence could be a proxy for the amount of content in the sentence; testing of a word within a sentence could be a type of test for the topic embedded in the sentence. 

But we aren't so clear as to what might be the sense in which task (c) could be useful for downstream applications. One instance where this matters seems to be cause-effect relationships. For example,  the order of 'Mary' and 'John' is critical in 'Mary stole an apple from John.' Such a pair of words tend to be  named entities, however. 

The tests presented in this manuscript worked with a random pair of words (and not just named entities or scenarios where cause-effect relationship mattered).

590,False,DRAGNN: A Transition-Based Framework for Dynamically Connected Neural Networks,"Overall, this is a nice paper. Developing a unifying framework for these newer
neural models is a worthwhile endeavor.

However, it's unclear if the DRAGNN framework (in its current form) is a
significant standalone contribution. The main idea is straightforward: use a
transition system to unroll a computation graph. When you implement models in
this way you can reuse code because modules can be mixed and matched. This is
nice, but (in my opinion) is just good software engineering, not machine 
learning research.

Moreover, there appears to be little incentive to use DRAGNN, as there are no
'free things' (benefits) that you get by using the framework. For example:

  tensorflow or dynet) you get gradients for 'free'.

  own. There is also a variety of algorithms for training the model in a

The paper proves that DRAGNNs can cover a wide range of transition-based methods in the literature. In addition, one can easily implement multitask learning systems with DRAGNNs. The experimental results shows that using DRAGNNs the authors built (near) state-of-the-art systems for 2 tasks: parsing and summarization. 

The paper contains two major parts: DRAGNN and demonstrations of its usages. 

Regarding to the first part, the proposed DRAGNN is a neat tool for building any transition-based systems. However, it is difficult to say whether the DRAGNN is novel. Transition-based framework is already well defined and there's a huge trend in NLP using neural networks to implement transition-based systems. In my opinion, the difference between the Stack-LSTM (Dyer et al., 2015) and DRAGNN is slight. Of course, the DRAGNN is a powerful architecture but the contribution here should be considered mainly in terms of software engineering.

In the second part, the authors used DRAGNN to implement new transition-based systems for different (multi-)tasks. The implementations are neat, confirming that DRAGNN is a powerful architecture, especially for multitask learning.

592,False,#Exploration: A Study of Count-Based Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"This paper proposed to use a simple count-based exploration technique in high-dimensional RL application (e.g., Atari Games). The counting is based on state hash, which implicitly groups (quantizes) similar state together. The hash is computed either via hand-designed features or learned features (unsupervisedly with auto-encoder). The new state to be explored receives a bonus similar to UCB (to encourage further exploration).

Overall the paper is solid with quite extensive experiments. I wonder how it generalizes to more Atari games. Montezuma’s Revenge may be particularly suitable for approaches that implicitly/explicitly cluster states together (like the proposed one), as it has multiple distinct scenarios, each with small variations in terms of visual appearance, showing clustering structures. On the other hand, such approaches might not work as well if the state space is fully continuous (e.g. in RLLab experiments). 

The authors did not answer my question about why the hash code needs to be updated during training. I think it is mainly because the code still needs to be adaptive for a particular game (to achieve lower reconstruction error) in the first few iterations .

594,False,#Exploration: A Study of Count-Based Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"This paper introduces a new way of extending the count based exploration approach to domains where counts are not readily available. The way in which the authors do it is through hash functions. Experiments are conducted on several domains including control and Atari. 

It is nice that the authors confirmed the results of Bellemare in that given the right ""density"" estimator, count based exploration can be effective. It is also great the observe that given the right features, we can crack games like Montezuma's revenge to some extend.

I, however, have several complaints:

First, by using hashing, the authors did not seem to be able to achieve significant improvements over past approaches. Without ""feature engineering"", the authors achieved only a fraction of the performance achieved in Bellemare et al. on Montezuma's Revenge. The proposed approaches In the control domains, the authors also does not outperform VIME. So experimentally, it is very hard to justify the approach. 

Second, hashing, although could be effective in the domains that the authors tested on, it may not be the best way of estimating densities going forward. As the environments get more complicated, some learning methods, are required for the understanding of the environments instead of blind hashing. The authors claim that the advantage of the proposed method over Bellemare et al. is that one does not have to design density estimators. But I would argue that density estimators have become readily available (PixelCNN, VAEs, Real NVP, GANs) that they can be as easily applied as can hashing.

I think the point that bonus-based algorithms might ""focus on trivial details"" is quite relevant -- this will clearly be a fundamental issue of exploration going forward. Showing that count generalization can be done with LSH is also quite valuable. A few comments:

1) Rather than try to separate the hash-table approach from the density model approach, I want to view the two as doing similar things. The LSH + counting scheme implies a density model of the form n(c_t) / total_count. So one might view your approach as using a hash-based density model, which I think is really cool!

2) On the hashing front: I would have expected a set of hash tables, as is typically done in the sketches literature, to work better. Did you consider approaches such as the count-min sketch?

3) It might be worth pointing out that the scores in Table 1 aren't completely comparable, as some very relevant parameters differ: the evaluation epsilons, the type of stochastic perturbation involved, etc. This shouldn't detract from the results, since your approach is clearly outperforming the no-smart-exploration baseline.

596,False,Modelling Relational Time Series using Gaussian Embeddings,"This manuscript proposes an approach for modeling correlated timeseries through a combination of loss functions which depend on neural networks. The loss functions correspond to: data fit term, autoregressive latent state term, and a term which captures relations between pairs of timeseries (relations have to be given as prior information).

Modeling relational timeseries is a well-researched problem, however little attention has been given to it in the neural network community. Perhaps the reason for this is the importance of having uncertainty in the representation. The authors correctly identify this need and consider an approach which considers distributions in the state space.

The formulation is quite straightforward by combining loss functions. The model adds to Ziat et al. 2016 in certain aspects which are well motivated, but unfortunately implemented in an unconvincing way. To start with, uncertainty is not treated in a very principled way, since the inference in the model is rather naive; I'd expect employing a VAE framework [1] for better uncertainty handling. Furthermore, the Gaussian co-variance collapses into a variance, which is the opposite of what one would want for modelling correlated time-series. There are approaches which take these correlations into account in the states, e.g. [2].

Moreover, the treatment of uncertainty only allows for linear decoding function f. This significantly reduces the power of the model. State of the art methods in timeseries modeling have moved beyond this constraint, especially in the Gaussian process community e.g. [2,3,4,5]. Comparing to a few of these methods, or at least discussing them would be useful.

One innovation is that the prior structure of the correlation needs to be given. This is a potentially useful and also original structural component. However, it also constitutes a limitation in some sense, since it is unrealistic in many scenarios to have this prior information. Moreover, the particular regularizer that makes ""similar"" timeseries to have closeness in the state space seems problematic. Some timeseries groups might be more ""similar"" than others, and also the similarity might be of different nature across groups. These variations cannot be well captured/distilled by a simple indicator variable e_ij. Furthermore, these variables are in practice taken to be binary (by looking at the experiments), which would make it even harder to model rich correlations. 

The experiments show that the proposed method works, but they are not entirely convincing. Importantly, they do not shed enough light into the different properties of the model w.r.t its different parts. For example, the effect and sensitivity of the different regularizers. The authors state in a pre-review answer that they amended with some more results, but I can't see a revision in openreview (please let me know if I've missed it). From the performance point of view, the results are not particularly exciting, especially given the fact that it's not clear which loss is better (making it difficult to use the method in practice). 

It would also be very interesting to report the optimized values of the parameters \lambda, to get an idea of how the different losses behave.

Timeseries analysis is a very well-researched area. Given the above, it's not clear to me why one would prefer to use this model over other approaches. Methodology wise, there are no novel components that offer a proven advantage with respect to past methods.

This paper introduces a nonlinear dynamical model for multiple related multivariate time series. It models a linear observation model conditioned on the latent variables, a linear or nonlinear dynamical model between consecutive latent variables and a similarity constraint between any two time series (provided as prior data and non-learnable). The predictions/constraints given by the three components of the model are Gaussian, because the model predicts both the mean and the variance or covariance matrix. Inference is forward only.

The model is evaluated on four datasets, and compared to several baselines: plain auto-regressive models, feed-forward networks, RNN and dynamic factor graphs DFGs, which are RNNs with forward and backward inference of the latent variables.

The model, which introduces lateral constraints between different time series, and which predicts both the mean and covariance seems interesting, but presents two limitations.

First of all, the paper should refer to variational auto-encoders / deep gaussian models, which also predict the mean and the variance during inference.

Secondly, the datasets are extremely small. For example, the WHO contains only 91 times series of 52*10 = 520 time points. Although the experiments seem to suggest that the proposed model tends to outperform RNNs, the datasets are very small and the high variance in the results indicates that further experiments, with longer time series, are required. The paper could also easily be extended with more information about the model (what is the architecture of the MLP) as well as time complexity comparison between the models (especially between DFGs and this model).

We know relu models need to split apart and unite different region of the space, and I think we can agree that we can construct such mechanism (it comes from the fact that relu models are universal approximators) .. though this doesn't speak to what happens in practice.

This paper looks at the structure of the preimage of a particular activity at a hidden layer of a network. It proves that any particular activity has a preimage of a piecewise linear set of subspaces.

Formalizing the geometry of the preimages of a particular activity vector would increase our understanding of networks

Analysis seems quite preliminary, and no novel theoretical results or clear practical conclusions.

The main theoretical conclusion seems to be the preimage being this stitch of lower dimensional subspaces? Would a direct inductive approach have worked? (e.g. working backwards from the penultimate layer say?)

This paper studies the preimages of outputs of a feedforward neural network with ReLUs.

COMMENTS 
- In the first version the paper contains many typos and appears to be still quite unpolished. 

- The paper contains nice ideas but in my opinion it does not contribute sufficiently many results for a Conference paper. 
I would be happy to recommend for the Workshop track. 

- Irreversibly mixed and several other notions from the present paper are closely related to the concepts discussed in [Montufar, Pascanu, Cho, Bengio, NIPS 2014]. I feel that that paper should be cited here and the connections should be discussed. In particular, that paper also contains a discussion on the local linear maps of ReLU networks. 

- I am curious about the practical considerations when computing the pre-images. The definition should be rather straight forward really, but the implementation / computation could be troublesome.

601,False,Efficient Summarization with Read-Again and Copy Mechanism,"This work explores the neural models for sentence summarisation by using a read-again attention model and a copy mechanism which grants the ability of direct copying word representations from the source sentences. The experiments demonstrate the model achieved better results on DUC dataset. Overall, this paper is not well-written. There are confusing points, some of the claims are lack of evidence and the experimental results are incomplete. 

Detailed comments:
 
-Read-again attention. How does it work better than a vanilla attention? What would happen if you read the same sentences multiple times? Have you compared it with staked LSTM (with same number of parameters)? There is no model ablation in the experiment section. 

-Why do you need reading two sentences? The Gigaword dataset is a source-to-compression dataset which does not need multiple input sentences. How do you compare your model with single sent input and two sent input?

-Copy mechanism. What if there are multiple same words appeared in the source sentences to be copied? According to equation (5), you only copy one vector to the decoder. However, there is no this kind of issue for a hard copy mechanism. Besides, there is no comparison between the hard copy mechanism and this vector copy mechanism in the experiment section

-Vocabulary size. This part is a bit off the main track of this paper. If there is no evidence showing this is the special property of vector copy mechanism, it would be trivial in this paper. 

-Experiments. On the DUC dataset, it compares the model with other up-to-date models, while on the Gigaword dataset paper only compares the model with the ABS Rush et al. (2015) and the GRU (?), which are quite weak baseline models. It is irresponsible to claim this model achieved the state-of-the-art performance in the context of summarization.

603,False,Efficient Summarization with Read-Again and Copy Mechanism,"Summary: This paper proposes a read-again attention-based representation of the document with the copy mechanism for the summarization task. The model reads each sentence in the input document twice and creates a hierarchical representation of it instead of a bidirectional RNN. During the decoding, it uses the representation of the document obtained via the read-again mechanism and points the words that are OOV in the source document. The model does abstractive summarization. The authors show improvements on DUC 2004 dataset and provide an analysis of their model with different configurations.

Contributions:
The main contribution of this paper is the read-again attention mechanism where the model reads the same sentence twice and obtains a better representation of the document.

Writing:
The text of this paper needs more work. There are several typos and the explanations of the model/architecture are not really clear, some parts of the paper feel somewhat bloated. 

Pros:
- The proposed model is a simple extension to the model to the model proposed in [2] for summarization.
- The results are better than the baselines.

Cons:
- The improvements are not that large.
- Justifications are not strong enough.
- The paper needs a better writeup. Several parts of the text are not using a clear/precise language and the paper needs a better reorganization. Some parts of the text is somewhat informal.
- The paper is very application oriented.

Question:
- How does the training speed when compared to the regular LSTM?

Some Criticisms:

A similar approach to the read again mechanism which is proposed in this paper has already been explored in [1] in the context of algorithmic learning and I wouldn’t consider the application of that on the summarization task a significant contribution.  The justification behind the read-again mechanism proposed in this paper is very weak. It is not really clear why additional gating alpha_i is needed for the read again stage.
As authors also suggest, pointer mechanism for the unknown/rare words [2] and it is adopted for the read-again attention mechanism. However, in the paper, it is not clear where the real is the gain coming from, whether from “read-again” mechanism or the use of “pointing”. 
The paper is very application focused, the contributions of the paper in terms of ML point of view is very weak.
It is possible to try this read-again mechanism on more tasks other than summarization, such as NMT, in order to see whether if those improvements are 
The writing of this paper needs more work. In general, it is not very well-written.

Some of the corrections that I would recommend fixing,

On page 4: “… better than a single value … ” —> “… scalar gating …”
On page 4: “… single value lacks the ability to model the variances among these dimensions.” —> “… scalar gating couldn’t capture the ….”

604,False,Efficient Summarization with Read-Again and Copy Mechanism,"This paper proposed two incremental ideas to extend the current state-of-the-art summarization work based on seq2seq models with attention and copy/pointer mechanisms.

1. This paper introduces 2-pass reading where the representations from the 1st-pass is used to  re-wight the contribution of each word to the sequential representation of the 2nd-pass. The authors described how such a so-called read-again process applies to both GRU and LSTM.
 
2. On the decoder side, the authors also use the softmax to choose between generating from decoder vocabulary and copying a source position, with a new twist of representing the previous decoded word Y_{t-1} differently. This allows the author to explore a smaller decoder vocabulary hence led to faster inference time without losing summarization performance.
 
This paper claims the new state-of-the-art on DUC2004 but the comparison on Gigaword seems to be incomplete (missing more recent results after Rush 2015 etc). While the overall work is solid, there are also other things missing scientifically. For example, 
- how much computational costs does the 2nd pass reading add to the end-to-end system? 
- How does the decoder small vocabulary trick work without 2nd-pass reading on the encoder side for both summarization performance and runtime speed?
- There are other ways to improve the embedding of a sentence. How does the 2nd-pass reading compare to recent work from multiple authors on self-attention and/or LSTMN?

The contribution is not extremely novel: the change with respect to weight normalization is minor. The experiments are also not very convincing: Layer normalization is reported to have higher test error as it overfits on their example, but in terms of optimization it seems to work better.

2) The experimental results show marginal improvements, of which the the statistical significance is impossible to asses. (Not completely the author’s fault for PTB, as they partially rely on results published by others.) Weight normalisation seems to be a viable alternative in the: the performance and runtime are similar. The implementation complexity of weight norm is, however, arguably much lower. More effort could have been put in by the authors to clear that up.

All expectation-based algorithms (and their KL-regularized cousins a-la TRPO) take smallish steps, and this might be a sensible way to accelerate them.

My main reservation is whether it is completely appropriate for ICLR, since the log-concavity assumption the model relies on appear to restrict to simpler models where representations will be not in fact be learned.

Other comments:
- There is a general lack of baselines in the numerical experiment section. I acknowledge this is somewhat of an unusual setting, but even a simple, well-justified baseline would have been welcome. Since cartpole is a relatively simple problem and the advertising dataset is presumably private, perhaps a way to generate a synthetic advertising dataset would have been interesting.

- There is an interesting section on constrained optimization, but as it is, feels a bit disconnected from the rest of the paper.

Cartpole only optimizes 5 parameters. Ad targeting task lacks comparison with alternative methods. Since this method is built on PoWER and closely connected with RWR, it is likely there are limits to performance which may become apparent when the method is tried on other domains and with other benchmark methods, e.g. even standard ones like importance sampling-based off-policy learning is known to suffer in high-dimensional or continuous action space; limits of RWR/PoWER-like methods based on their connection with entropy-regularized RL.

612,False,GRAM: Graph-based Attention Model for Healthcare Representation Learning,"SUMMARY.
This paper presents a method for enriching medical concepts with their parent nodes in an ontology.
The method employs an attention mechanism over the parent nodes of a medical concept to create a richer representation of the concept itself.
The rationale of this is that for  infrequent medical concepts the attention mechanism will rely more on general concepts, higher in the ontology hierarchy, while for frequent ones will focus on the specific concept.
The attention mechanism is trained together with a recurrent neural network and the model accuracy is tested on two tasks.
The first task aims at prediction the diagnosis categories at each time step, while the second task aims at predicting whether or not a heart failure is likely to happen after the T-th step.

Results shows that the proposed model works well in condition of data insufficiency.

OVERALL JUDGMENT
The proposed model is simple but interesting.
The ideas presented are worth to expand but there are also some points where the authors could have done better.
The learning of the representation of concepts in the ontology is a bit naive, for example the authors could have used some kind of knowledge base factorization approach to learn the concepts, or some graph convolutional approach.
I do not see why the the very general factorization methods for knowledge bases do not apply in the case of ontology learning.
I also found strange that the representation of leaves are fine tuned while the inner nodes are not, it is a specific reason to do so?

Regarding the presentation, the paper is clear and the qualitative evaluation is insightful.

The paper focuses on sequential prediction given a patient’s medical record (a sequence of medical codes, some of which might occur very rarely). Instead of simply assigning each medical code an independent embedding before feeding it to an RNN, the proposed approach assigns each node in the medical ontology a “basic” embedding, and composes a “final” embedding for each medical code by taking a learned weighted average (via an attention mechanism) of the medical code’s ancestors in the ontology. Notably, the paper is well written and the approach is quite intuitive.
I have the following comments: 
- Why is the patient’s visit taken as just the sum of medical codes found in the visit, and not say the average or a learned weighted average? Wouldn’t this bias for/against the number of codes in the visit?

---

This paper introduces an approach for integrating a direct acyclic graph structure of the data into word / code embeddings, in order to leverage domain knowledge and thus help train an RNN with scarce data. It is applied to codes of medical visits. Each code is part of an ontology, which can be represented by a DAG, where codes correspond to leaf nodes, and where different codes may share common ancestors (non-leaf nodes) in the DAG. Instead of embedding merely the leaf nodes, one can also embed the non-leaf nodes, and the embeddings of the code and its ancestors can be combined using a convex sum. That convex sum can be seen as an attention mechanism over the representation. The attention weights depend on the embeddings and the weights of an MLP, meaning that the model can separate learning the code embeddings and the interaction between the codes. Embedding codes are pretrained using GloVe, then fine-tuned.

The model is properly evaluated on two medical datasets, with several variations to isolate the contribution of the DAG (GRAM or GRAM+ vs. RNN or RandomDAG) and of pretraining the embeddings (RNN+ vs RNN, GRAM+ vs GRAM). Both are shown to help achieve the best performance and the evaluation methodology seems thorough.

The paper is also well written, and the case for MLP attention instead of a plain dot product of embeddings was made by the authors.

My only two comments would be:
1) Why is there a softmax in equation 4, given that the loss is multivariate cross-entropy (in the predicted visit, several codes could be equal to 1), not a a single-class cross-entropy?
2) What is the embedding dimension m?",,6.0,4.0
616,False,On Robust Concepts and Small Neural Nets,"SUMMARY 
This paper presents a study of the number of hidden units and training examples needed to learn functions from a particular class. 
This class is defined as those Boolean functions with an upper bound on the variability of the outputs. 

PROS
The paper promotes interesting results from the theoretical computer science community to investigate the efficiency of representation of functions with limited variability in terms of shallow feedforward networks with linear threshold units. 

CONS 
The analysis is limited to shallow networks. The analysis is based on piecing together interesting results, however without contributing significant innovations. 
The presentation of the main results and conclusions is somewhat obscure, as the therein appearing terms/constants do not express a clear relation between increased robustness and decreasing number of required hidden units. 

COMMENTS 

- In the abstract one reads ``The universal approximation theorem for neural networks says that any reasonable function is well-approximated by a two-layer neural network with sigmoid gates but it does not provide good bounds on the number of hidden-layer nodes or the weights.'' 

In page 1 the paper points the reader to a review article. It could be a good idea to include also more recent references. 

Given the motivation presented in the abstract of the paper it would be a good idea to also comment of works discussing the classes of Boolean functions representable by linear threshold networks. 
For instance the paper [Hyperplane Arrangements Separating Arbitrary Vertex Classes in n-Cubes. Wenzel, Ay, Paseman] discusses various classes of functions that can be represented by shallow linear threshold networks and provides upper and lower bounds on the number of hidden units needed for representing various types of Boolean functions. In particular that paper also provides lower bounds on the number of hidden units needed to define a universal approximator. 

- It certainly would be a good idea to discuss the results on the learning complexity in terms of measures such as the VC-dimension. 

- Thank you for the explanations regarding the constants.  
So if the noise sensitivity is kept constant, larger values of epsilon are associated with a smaller value of delta and of 1/epsilon. 
Nonetheless, the description in Theorem 2 is in terms of poly(1/epsilon, 1/delta), which still could increase? 
Also, in Lemma 1 reducing the sensitivity at a constant noise increases the bound on k? 

- The fact that the descriptions are independent of n seems to be related to the definition of the noise sensitivity as an expectation over all inputs. This certainly deserves more discussion. One good start could be to discuss examples of functions with an upper bound on the noise sensitivity (aside from the linear threshold functions discussed in Lemma 2). 
Also, reverse statements to Lemma 1 would be interesting, describing the noise sensitivity of juntas specifically, even if only as simple examples. 

- On page 3 ``...variables is polynomial in the noise-sensitivity parameters'' should be inverse of?

But my current major concern is that this work is only constrained to the domain of boolean hypercube, which is far from what is done in practice (continuous domain). Indeed, the authors could argue that understanding the former is a first step, but if the connection is only suitable for this case and not adaptable to more general scenarios, then it probably would have limited interest.",,6.0,2.0
618,False,On Robust Concepts and Small Neural Nets,"The approximation capabilities of neural networks have been studied before for approximating different classes of functions. The goal of this paper is to provide an analog of the approximation theorem for the class of noise-stable functions. The class of functions that are noise-stable and their output does not significantly depend on an individual input seems an interesting class and therefore I find the problem definition interesting.  The paper is well-written and it is easy to follow the proofs and arguments. 

I have two major comments:

1- Presentation: The way I understand this arguments is that the noise-stability measures the ""true"" dimensionality of the data based on the dependence of the function on different dimensions. Therefore, it is possible to restate and prove an analog to the approximation theorems based on ""true"" dimensionality of data. It is also unclear when the stability based bounds are tighter than dimension based bounds as both of them grow exponentially. I find these discussions interesting but unfortunately, the authors present the result as some bound that does not depend on the dimension and a constant (!??) that grows exponentially with (1/eps). This is not entirely the right picture because the epsilon in the stability could itself depend on the dimension. I believe in most problems (1/epsilon) grows with the dimension. 

2- Contribution: Even though the connection is new and interesting, the contribution of the paper is not significant enough.

The augmented loss is heavily “engineered” to produce the desired result of parameter tying. It’s not clear what happens if you try to relax it a bit, by adding parameters, or estimating y~ in a different way. 

Nevertheless the argument is very interesting, and clearly written.
The simulated results indeed validate the argument, and the PTB results seem promising.

620,True,Tying Word Vectors and Word Classifiers: A Loss Framework for Language Modeling,"This work offers a theoretical justification for reusing the input word embedding in the output projection layer. It does by proposing an additional loss that is designed to minimize the distance between the predictive distribution and an estimate of the true data distribution. This is a nice setup since it can effectively smooth over the labels given as input. However, the construction of the estimate of the true data distribution seems engineered to provide the weight tying justification in Eqs. 3.6 and 3.7.

It is not obvious why the projection matrix L in Eq 3.6 (let's rename it to L') should be the same as that in Eq. 2.1. For example, L' could be obtained through word2vec embeddings trained on a large dataset or it could be learned as an additional set of parameters. In the case that L' is a new learned matrix, it seems the result in Eq 4.5 is to use an independent matrix for the output projection layer, as is usually done.

The experimental results are good and provide support for the approximate derivation done in section 4, particularly the distance plots in figure 1.

It is a nice application of using deep features. However, I lean toward rejecting the paper because the following reasons:

1) All experiments are conducted in very small scale. The experiments include 6 fish species, 11 canine species, 8 vehicle classes. There are no quantitative results, only by visualizing the generated tree versus the wordNet tree. Moreover, the assumption of using wordNet is not quite valid. WordNet is not designed for biology purpose and it might not reflect the true evolutionary relationship between species.

There are two claimed contributions: (1) Constructs a biology evolutionary tree, and (2) Gives insight into the representations produced by deep networks. 

Regarding (1), while the motivation of the work is grounded in biology, in practice the method is based only on visual similarity. The constructed trees thus can’t be expected to reflect the evolutionary hierarchy, and in fact there are no quantitative experiments that demonstrate that they do. 

Regarding (2), the technical depth of the exploration is not sufficient for ICLR. I’m not sure what we can conclude from the paper beyond the fact that CNNs are able to group categories together based on visual similarities, and deeper networks are able to do this better than more shallow networks (Fig 2).

Or, at least, that would be a good narrative but I'm not confident biologists would actually care about the ""Tree of Life"" built from this method. There's not really any biology in this paper, either in methodology or evaluation. It boils down to a hierarchical clustering of visual categories with ground truth assumed to be the WordNet hierarchy (which may or may not be the biological ground truth inheritance relationships between species, if that is even possible to define -- it probably isn't for dog species which interbreed and it definitely isn't for vehicles) or the actual biological inheritance tree or what humans would do in the same task. If we're just worried about visual relationships and not inheritance relationships then a graph is the right structure, not a tree. A tree is needlessly lossy and imposes weird relationships (e.g. ImageNet has a photo of a ""toy rabbit"" and by tree distance it is maximally distant from ""rabbit"" because the toy is in the devices top level hierarchy and the real rabbit is in the animal branch. Are those two images really as semantically unrelated as is possible?). Our visual world is not a hierarchy. Our biological world can reasonably be defined as one. One could define the task of trying to recover the biological inheritance tree from visual inputs, although we know that would be tough to do because of situations like convergent evolution. Still, one could evaluate how well various visual features can recover the hierarchical relationship of biological organisms. This paper doesn't quite do that. And even if it did, it would still feel like a bit of a solution in search of a problem. The paper says that this type of exercise can help us understand deep features, but I'm not sure sure how much it reveals. I guess it's a fair question to ask if a particular feature produces meaningful class-to-class distances, but it's not clear that the biological tree of life or the wordnet hierarchy is the right ground truth for that (I'd argue it's not).

Finally, the paper mentions human baselines in a few places but I'm not really seeing it.

The paper is well-written, the idea is carefully analyzed, and the experiments are convincing, so we recommend acceptance. For a stronger recommendation, it would be valuable to perform more experiments. In particular, how does your smoothing technique compare to inserting probes in various layers of the network? Another interesting question would be how it performs on hard-to-optimize tasks such as algorithm learning. For example, in the ""Neural GPU Learns Algorithms"" paper the authors had to relax the weights of different layers of their RNN to make it optimize -- could this be avoided with your smoothing technique?",,7.0,5.0
628,True,Mollifying Networks,"The paper shows the relation between stochastically perturbing the parameter of a model at training time, and considering a mollified objective function for optimization. Aside from Eqs. 4-7 where I found hard to understand what the weak gradient g exactly represents, Eq. 8 is intuitive and the subsequent Section 2.3 clearly establishes for a given class of mollifiers the equivalence between minimizing the mollified loss and training under Gaussian parameter noise.

The authors then introduce generalized mollifiers to achieve a more sophisticated annealing effect applicable to state-of-the-art neural network architectures (e.g. deep ReLU nets and LSTM recurrent networks). The resulting annealing effect can be counterintuitive: In Section 4, the Binomial (Bernoulli?) parameter grows from 0 (deterministic identity layers) to 1 (deterministic ReLU layers), meaning that the network goes initially through a phase of adding noise. This might effectively have the reverse effect of annealing.

Annealing schemes used in practice seem very engineered (e.g. Algorithm 1 that determines how units are activated at a given layer consists of 9 successive steps).

Due to the more conceptual nature of the authors contribution (various annealing schemes have been proposed, but the application of the mollifying framework is original), it could have been useful to reserve a portion of the paper to analyze simpler models with more basic (non-generalized) mollifiers. For example, I would have liked to see simple cases, where the perturbation schemes derived from the mollifier framework would be demonstrably more suitable for optimization than a standard heuristically defined perturbation scheme.",,6.0,4.0

The idea and motivation of this paper are interesting and sound. As mentioned in my pre-review question, I was wondering about the relationship with shaping methods in RL. I agree with the authors that this paper differs from how shaping typically works (by modifying the problem itself) because in their implementation the architecture is what is ""shaped"". Nevertheless, the central idea in both cases is to solve a series of optimization problems of increasing difficulty. Therefore, I strongly suggest including a discussion of the differences between shaping, curriculum learning (I'm also not sure how this is different from shaping), and the present approach.

The presentation of the method for neural networks lacks clarity in presentation. Improving this presentation will make this paper much easier to digest. In particular:
- Alg. 1 can not be understood at the point that it is referenced. 
- Please explain the steps to Eq. 25 more clearly and connect to steps 1-6 in Alg. 1.
- Define u(x) clearly before defining u*(x)

There are several concerns with the experimental evaluations. There should be a discussion about why doesn't the method work for solving much more challenging network training problems, such as thin and deep networks. Some specific concerns:

- The MLPs trained (Parity and Pentomino) are not very deep at all. An experiment of training thin networks with systematically increasing depth would be a better fit to test this method. Network depth is well known to pose optimization challenges. Instead, it is stated without reference that ""Learning the mapping from sequences of characters to the word-embeddings is a difficult problem.""

- For cases where the gain is primarily due to the regularization effect, this method should be compared to other weight noise regularization methods.

- I also suggest comparing to highway networks, since there are thematic similarities in Eq. 22, and it is possible that they can automatically anneal their behavior from simple to complex nets during training, considering that they are typically initialized with a bias towards copying behavior.

- For CIFAR-10 experiment, does the mollified model also use Residual connections? If so, why? In either case, why does the mollified net actually train slower than the residual and stochastic depth networks? This is inconsistent with the MLP results.

The two main reasons for why the authors decided to use linear probes seem to be:
- convexity
- The last layer in the network is (usually) linear

In the second to last paragraph of page 4 the authors point out that it could happen that the intermediate features are useless for a linear classifier. This is correct and what I consider the main flaw of the paper. I am missing any motivation as to the usefulness of the suggested analysis to architecture design. In fact, the example with the skip connection (Figure 8) seems to suggest that skip connections shouldn't be used. Doesn't that contradict the recent successes of ResNet?

In particular, the fact that the authors did not provide any results in ""real"" networks, which are used to win competitions makes the results less strong, since researchers who want to created competitive network architectures don't have enough evidence from this work to decides whether they should use it or not.

Ideally, I would encourage the authors to consider continuing this line of research and show how to use the information given by these linear classifiers to construct better network architectures.

The observations in this paper agrees with existing insights, such as, 1) (Fig 5a) too many random layers are harmful. 2) (Fig 5b) training is helpful. 3) (Fig 7) lower layers converge faster than higher layer. 4) (Fig 8) too deep network is hard to train, and skip link can remedy this problem.

However, this paper has following problems:

1. It is not sufficiently justified why the linear classifier is a good probe. It is not crystal clear why good intermediate features need to show high linear classification accuracy. More theoretical analysis and/or intuition will be helpful.   
2. This paper does not provide much insight on how to design better networks based on the observations. Designing a better network is also the best way to justify the usefulness of the analysis.

633,True,Combining policy gradient and Q-learning,"This paper shows how policy gradient and Q-Learning may be combined together, improving learning as demonstrated in particular in the Atari Learning Environment. The core idea is to note that entropy-regularized policy gradient leads to a Boltzmann policy based on Q values, thus linking pi & Q together and allowing both policy gradient and Q-Learning updates to be applied.

I think this is a very interesting paper, not just for its results and the proposed algorithm (dubbed PGQ), but mostly because of the links it draws between several techniques, which I found quite insightful.

That being said, I also believe it could have done a better job at clearly exposing these links: I found it somewhat difficult to follow, and it took me a while to wrap my head around it, even though the underlying concepts are not that complex. In particular:
- The notation \tilde{Q}^pi is introduced in a way that is not very clear, as ""an estimate of the Q-values"" while eq. 5 is an exact equality (no estimation)
- It is not clear to me what section 3.2 is bringing exactly, I wonder if it could just be removed to expand some other sections with more explanations.
- The links to dueling networks (Wang et al, 2016) are in my opinion not explicit and detailed enough (in 3.3 & 4.1): as far as I can tell the proposed architecture ends up being very similar to such networks and thus it would be worth telling more about it (also in experiments my understanding is that the ""variant of asynchronous deep Q-learning"" being used is essentially such a dueling network, but it is not clearly stated). I also believe it should be mentioned that PGQ can also be seen as combining Q-Learning with n-step expected Sarsa using a dueling network: this kind of example helps better understand the links between methods
- Overall I wish section 3.3 was clearer, as it draws some very interesting links, but it is hard to see where this is all going when reading the paper for the first time. One confusing point is w.r.t. to the relationship with section 3.2, that assumes a critic outputting Q values while in 3.3 the critic outputs V. The ""mu"" distribution also comes somewhat out of nowhere.

I hope the authors can try and improve the readability of the paper in a final version, as well as clarify the points raised in pre-review questions (in particular related to experimental details, the derivation of eq. 4, and the issue of the discounted distribution of states).

Minor remarks:
- The function r(s, a) used in the Bellman equation in section 2 is not formally defined. It looks a bit weird because the expectation is on s' and b' but r(s, a) does not depend on them (so either it should be moved out of the expectation, or the expectation should also be over the reward, depending on how r is defined)
- The definition of the Boltzmann policy at end of 2.1 is a bit confusing since there is a sum over ""a"" of a quantity that does not depend (clearly) on ""a""
- I believe 4.3 is for the tabular case but this is not clearly stated
- Any idea why in Fig. 1 the 3 algorithms do not all converge to the same policy? In such a simple toy setting I would expect it to be the case.

Typos:
- ""we refer to the classic text Sutton & Barto (1998)"" => missing ""by""?
- ""Online policy gradient typically require an estimate of the action-values function"" => requires & value
- ""the agent generates experience from interacting the environment"" => with the environment
- in eq. 12 (first line) there is a comma to remove near the end, just before the dlog pi
- ""allowing us the spread the influence of a reward"" => to spread

Small concern in general case derivation: 
Section 3.2: Eq. (7) the expectation (s,a) is wrt to \pi, which is a function of \theta -- that dependency seems to be ignored, although it is key to the PG update derivation. If these policies(the sampling policy for the expectation and \pi) are close enough it's usually okay -- but except for particular cases (trust-region methods & co), that's generally not true. Thus, you might end up solving a very different problem than the one you actually care solving.

Developing convolutional or recurrent architectures for graph-like data is an important problem because we would like to develop neural networks that can handle inputs such as molecule structures or social networks.

They don't specify which k that used, just that it was big enough for their to be p=5 nodes obtained as neighbors. In the second experiment (MNIST), they used k=1 for their experiments, which is what previous work (Coats & Ng 2011) proposed as well.

This paper proposes a variant of the convolution operation suitable for a broad class of graph structures. For each node in the graph, a set of neighbours is devised by means of random walk (the neighbours are ordered by the expected number of visits). As a result, the graph is transformed into a feature matrix resembling MATLAB’s/Caffe’s im2col output. The convolution itself becomes a matrix multiplication. 

Although the proposed convolution variant seems reasonable, I’m not convinced by the empirical evaluation. The MNIST experiment looks especially suspicious. I don’t think that this dataset is appropriate for the demonstration purposes in this case. In order to make their method applicable to the data, the authors remove important structural information (relative locations of pixels) thus artificially increasing the difficulty of the task. At the same time, they are comparing their approach with regular CNNs and conclude that the former performs poorly (and does not even reach an acceptable accuracy for the particular dataset).

This extension to keypoint/segment conditioning is the primary contribution over existing PixelCNN work.  Qualitative comparison is made to GAN approaches for synthesis.

Does it, though? Because the resolution is so bad. And resolution limitations aren't addressed until the second-to-last paragraph of the paper. And Figure 9 only shows 3 results (picked randomly? Picked to be favorable to PixelCNN?). That hardly seems conclusive.

The segmentation masks and keypoints are pretty strong input constraints. It's hard to tell how much coherent object and scene detail is emerging because the resolution is so low. For example, the cows in figure 5 look like color blobs, basically. Any color blob that follows an exact cow segmentation mask will look cow-like.

The amount of variation is impressive, though.

How can we assess how much the model is ""replaying"" training data? Figure 8 tries to get at this, but I wonder how much each of the ""red birds"", for instance, is mostly copied from a particular training example.

I'm unsatisfied with the answers to the pre-review questions. You didn't answer my questions. The paper would benefit from concrete numbers on training time / epochs and testing time. You didn't say why you can't make high resolution comparisons. Yes, it's slower at test time. Is it prohibitively slow? Or is it slightly inconvenient? There really aren't that many comparisons in the paper, anyway, so it if takes an hour to generate a result that doesn't seem prohibitive. 

To be clear about my biases: I don't think PixelCNN is ""the right way"" to do deep image generation. Texture synthesis methods used these causal neighborhoods with some success, but only because there wasn't a clear way to do the optimization more globally (Kwatra et al, Texture Optimization for Example-based Synthesis being one of the first alternatives). It seems simply incorrect to make hard decisions about what pixel values should be in one part of the image before synthesizing another part of the image (Another texture synthesis strategy to help fight back against this strict causality was coarse-to-fine synthesis. And I do see some deep image synthesis methods exploring that). It seems much more correct to have a deeper network and let all output pixels be conditioned on all other pixels (this conditioning will implicitly emerge at intermediate parts of the network). That said, I could be totally wrong, and the advantages stated in the paper could outweigh the disadvantages. But this paper doesn't feel very honest about the disadvantages.

Overall, I think the results are somewhat tantalizing, especially the ability to generate diverse outputs. But the resolution is extremely low, especially compared to the richness of the inputs. The network gets a lot of hand holding from rich inputs (it does at least learn to obey them). 

The deep image synthesis literature is moving very quickly. The field needs to move on from ""proof of concept"" papers (the first to show a particular result is possible) to more thorough comparisons. This paper has an opportunity to be a more in depth comparison, but it's not very deep in that regard. There isn't really an apples to apples comparison between PixelCNN and GAN nor is there a conclusion statement about why that is impossible. There isn't any large scale comparison, either qualitative or quantified by user studies, about the quality of the results.",,6.0,3.0

We welcome new comments!",,,
646,True,Delving into Transferable Adversarial Examples and Black-box Attacks,"The paper presents an interesting and very detailed study of targeted and non-targeted adversarial examples in CNNs.

I’m on the fence about this paper but am leaning towards acceptance. Such detailed empirical explorations are difficult and time-consuming to construct yet can serve as important stepping stones for future work. I see the length of the paper as a strength since it allows for a very in-depth look into the effectiveness and transferability of different kinds of adversarial examples.  

There are, however, some concerns:

1) While the length of the paper is a strength in my mind, the key contributions should be made much more clear. As evidenced by my comment earlier, I got confused at some point between the ensemble/non-ensemble method, and about the contribution of the Clarifai evaluation and what I should be focusing on where. I’d strongly suggest a radical revision which more clearly focuses the story: 

- First, we demonstrate that non-targeted attacks are easy while targeted attacks are hard (evidenced by a key experiment comparing the two; we refer to appendix or later sections for the extensive exploration of e.g., current Section 3)

- Thus, we propose an ensemble method that is able to handle targeted attacks much better (evidenced by experiments focusing on the comparison between ensemble and non-ensemble method, both in a controlled setting and on Clarifai)

- Also, here are all the other details and explorations. 

2) Instead of using ResNet-152, Res-Net-101 and ResNet-50 as three of the five models, it would've been better to use one ResNet architecture and the other two, say, AlexNet and Network-in-Network. This would make the ensemble results a lot more compelling.",,6.0,3.0
647,True,Delving into Transferable Adversarial Examples and Black-box Attacks,"This paper present an experimental study of the robustness of state-of-the-art CNNs to different types of ""attacks"" in the context of image classication. Specifically, an attack aims to fool the classification system with a specially corrupted image, i.e. making it misclassify the image as (1) any wrong class (non-targeted attack) or (2) a target class, chosen in advance by the attacker (targeted attack). For instance, the attacker could corrupt an image of an ostrich in such a way that it would be classified as a megalith. Even though the attacker's agenda is not so clear in this example, it is still interesting to study the weaknesses of current systems in view of (1) improving them in general and (2) actual risks with e.g. autonomous vehicles.

The paper is mostly experimental. In short, it compares different strategies (already published in previous papers) for all popular networks  (VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet-50/101/152) and the two aforementionned types of attacks. The experiments are well conducted and clearly exposed. A convincing point is that attacks are also conducted on ""clarifai.com"" which is a black-box classification system. Some analysis and insightful explanations are also provided to help understanding why CNNs are prone to such attacks (Section 6).

To sum up, the main findings are that non-targeted attacks are easy to perform, even on a black-box system. Non-targeted attacks are more difficult to realize with existing schemes, but the authors propose a new approach for that that vastly improves over existing attacks (even though it's still far from perfect: ~20% success rate on clarifai.com versus 2% with previous schemes).

Arguably, The paper still has some weaknesses:

 - The authors are treating the 3 ResNet-based networks as different, yet they are obviously clearly correlated. See Table 7 for instance. This is naturally expected because their architecture is similar (only their depth varies). Hence, it does not sound very fair to state that ""One interesting finding is that [...] the first misclassified label (non-targeted) is the same for all models except VGG-16 and GoogLeNet."", i.e., the three ResNet-based networks.

 - A subjective measure is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the attacks on the black box system. While this is for a good reason (clarifai.com returns image labels that are different from ImageNet), it is not certain that the reported numbers are fair (even though the qualitative results look convincing).

 - The novelty of the proposed approach (optimizing an ensemble of network instead of a single network) is limited. However, this was not really the point of the paper, and it is effective, so it seems ok overall.

 - The paper is quite long. This is expected because it is an extensive evaluation study, but still. I suggest the authors prune some near-duplicate content (e.g. Section 2.3 has a high overlap with Section 1, etc.).

 - The paper would benefit from additional discussions with the recent and related work of Fawzi et al (NIPS'16) in Section 6. Indeed the work of Fawzi et al. is mostly theoretical and well aligned with the experimental findings and observations (in particular in Section 6).

Paper Summary: 
The paper introduces a question answering model called Dynamic Coattention Network (DCN). It extracts co-dependent representations of the document and question, and then uses an iterative dynamic pointing decoder to predict an answer span. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all published models.

Paper Strengths: 
-- The proposed model introduces two new concepts to QA models -- 1) using attention in both directions, and 2) a dynamic decoder which iterates over multiple answer spans until convergence or maximum number of iterations.
-- The paper also presents ablation study of the proposed model which shows the importance of their design choices.
-- It is interesting to see the same idea of co-attention performing well in 2 different domains -- Visual Question Answering and machine reading comprehension.
-- The performance breakdown over document and question lengths (Figure 6) strengthens the importance of attention for QA task.
-- The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art result on SQuAD dataset.
-- The model architecture has been clearly described.

Paper Weaknesses / Future Thoughts: 
-- The paper provides model's performance when the maximum number of iterations is 1 and 4. I would like to see how the performance of the model changes with the number of iterations, i.e., the model performance when that number is 2 and 3. Is there a clear trend? What type of questions is the model able to get correct with more iterations?
-- As with many deep learning approaches, the overall architecture seems quite complex, and the design choices seem to be driven by performance numbers. As future work, authors might try to analyze qualitative advantages of different choices in the proposed model. What type of questions are correctly answered because of co-attention mechanism instead of attention in a single direction, when using Maxout Highway Network instead of a simple MLP, etc?

654,True,Dynamic Coattention Networks For Question Answering,"Summary: The paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture for the task of question answering on the SQuAD dataset. The model consists of two main components -- coattention encoder and dynamic pointer decoder. The encoder produces attention over the question as well as over the document in parallel and thus learns co-dependent representations of the question and the document. The decoder predicts the starting and the end token of the answer iteratively, with the motivation that multiple iterations will help the model escape local maxima and thus will reduce the errors made by the model. The proposed model achieved state-of-art result on SQuAD dataset at the time of writing the paper. The paper reports some analyses of the results such as performance across question types, document, question, answer lengths, etc. The paper also performs some ablation studies such as performing only single round of iteration on decoder, etc.

Strengths:

1. The paper is well-motivated with two main motivations -- co-attending to the document and the question, and iteratively producing the answer.

2. The proposed model architecture is novel and the design choices made seem reasonable.

3. The experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the existing model (at the time of writing the paper) on the SQuAD dataset by significant margin.

4. The analyses of the results and the ablation studies performed (as per someone's request) provide insights into the various modelling design choices made.

Weaknesses/Questions/Suggestions:

1. In order to gain insights into how much each additional iteration in the decoder help, I would like to see the following -- for every iteration report the mean F1 for questions that converged in that iteration along with the number of questions that converged in that iteration.

2. Example of Question 3 in figure 5 is an interesting example where the model is unable to decide between multiple local maxima despite several iterations. Could authors please report how often this happens?

3. In order to estimate how much modelling of attention in the encoder helps, it would be good if authors could report the performance of the model when attention is not modeled at all in the encoder (neither over question, nor over document).

4. I would like to see the variation in the performance of the proposed model for questions that require different types of reasoning (table 3 in SQuAD paper). This would provide insights into what are the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model w.r.t the type reasoning required.

5. In Wang and Jiang (2016), the attention is predicted over question for each word in the document. But in table 2, when performing ablation study to make the proposed model similar to Wang and Jiang, C^D is set to C^Q. But isn’t C^Q attention over document for each word in the question? So, how is this similar to Wang and Jiang’s attention? I think QA^D will be similar to Wang and Jiang's attention since QA^D is attention over question for each word in the document. Please clarify.

6. In section 2.1, “n” and “m” are swapped when explaining the Document and Question encoding matrix. Please fix it.

Review Summary: The paper presents a novel and interesting model for the task of question answering on SQuAD dataset and shows that the model outperforms existing models. However, to gain more insights into the functioning of the model, I would like see more analyses of the results and one more ablation study (see weaknesses section above).

For the sake of comparability, I would be interested to see how performances would change when:

- not using co-attention but only attention on the question for each context token, similar to Wang et al.
- exchanging the rather large Highway Maxout Network by something simpler, e.g. omitting m1 and m2 completely to get directly to the output, lowering pool-sizes because they seem rather large as well or using a simple MLP instead of the HMN. The intuition behind using Maxout sounds appealing but it has not been verified in the paper.
- allowing only one iteration for the pointer decoder (i.e., direct prediction)

657,False,Joint Multimodal Learning with Deep Generative Models,"This paper proposes an alternative to Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders and Conditional MultiModal Auto-Encoders to perform inference of missing modalities in dataset with multiple modalities. The proposed approach is a Variational Auto-Encoder jointly on all the modalities  with additional KL divergence penalties between the approximate posterior given all the modalities and the approximate posterior given a subset of the modalities. The approach is named Joint Multimodal Variational Auto-Encoder.
The authors make a connection between this approach and the Variation of Information. It is unclear why the authors chose the JMVAE approach instead of a more elegant Variation of Information approach.
Another unaddressed issue is the scalability of the method. As far as I can tell (given that no code is provided and the specification of the encoder is missing), this approach requires a new encoder per subset of missing modalities. Right now this approach seems to scale since there are only two modalities.
The fact that the estimating the log-likelihood log(p(x)) using multiple modalities provide a lower value than with just one in Table 1 is a bit odd. Could you explain that ?
The comparison with between the representation learned by JMVAE and CVAE might be unfair given that the representation of CVAE is learned conditionally, on the label in the case of MNIST, and should therefore not consider the label in this representation. Intuitively, this representation could represent ""style"" as shown in (Kingma et al., 2014) in their conditional generation figure.
For CelebA, comparing log-likelihood on models that use GANs is probably not significant since GAN does not optimizes log-likelihood.

The paper demonstrates its effectiveness on MNIST and CelebA datasets, both in terms of test log-likelihoods and the conditional image generation and editing.

The proposed method is rather straightforward extension of VAE and therefore the model should inherent the probabilistic inference methods of VAE.

The authors demonstrate that their method generalizes well to sequences of varying length as well as to new combinations of sub-goals (i.e., if the agent knows how to pick up a diamond and how to visit an apple, it can also visit the diamond). 

Overall, the paper is of high technical quality and presents an interesting and non-trivial combination of state-of-the-art advancements in Deep Learning (DL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).

The skills are learned using a differential temporally extended memory networks with an attention mechanism. The authors also make a novel use of analogy making and parameter prediction. 

However, I find it difficult to understand from the paper why the presented problem is interesting and why hadn't it bee solved before. Since the domain being evaluated is a simple 2D maze, using deep networks is not well motivated. Similar problems have been solved using simpler models. In particular, there is a reach literature about planning with skills that had been ignored completely by the authors. Since all of the skills are trained prior to the evaluation of the hierarchical agent, the problem that is being solved is much more similar to supervised learning than reinforcement learning (since when using the pre-trained skills the reward is not particularly delayed).

666,False,Communicating Hierarchical Neural Controllers for Learning Zero-shot Task Generalization,"Description:

This paper presents a reinforcement learning architecture where, based on ""natural-language"" input, a meta-controller chooses subtasks and communicates them to a subtask controller that choose primitive actions, based on the communicated subtask. The goal is to scale up reinforcement learning agents to large-scale tasks.

The subtask controller embeds the subtask definition (arguments) into vectors by a multi-layer perceptron including an ""analogy-making"" regularization. The subtask vectors are combined with inputs at each layer of a CNN. CNN outputs (given the observation and the subtask) are then fed to one of two MLPs; one to compute action probabilities in the policy (exponential falloff of MLP outputs) and the other to compute termination probability (sigmoid from MLP outputs).

The meta controller takes a list of sentences as instructions embeds them into a sequence of subtask arguments (not necessarily a one-to-one mapping). A context vector is computed by a CNN from the observation, the previous sentence embedding, the previous subtask and its completion state. The subtask arguments are computed from the context vector through further mechanisms involving instruction retrieval from memory pointers, and hard/soft decisions whether to update the subtask or not.

Training involves policy distillation+actor-critic training for the subtask controller, and actor-critic training for the meta controller keeping the subtask controller frozen.

The system is tested in a grid world where the agent moves and interacts with (picks up/transforms) various item/enemy types.
It is compared to a) a flat controller not using a subtask controller, and b) subtask control by mere concatenation of the subtask embedding to the input with/without the analogy-making regularization.


Evaluation:

The proposed architecture seems reasonable, although it is not clear why the specific way of combining subtask embeddings in the subtask controller would be the ""right"" way to do it.

I do not feel the grid world here really represents a ""large-scale task"": in particular the 10x10 size of the grid is very small. This is disappointing since this was a main motivation of the work.

Moreover, the method is not compared to any state of the art alternatives. This is especially problematic because the test is not on established benchmarks. It is not really possible, based on the shown results, to put the performance in context of other works.

This is quite related to how humans learn complex tasks in many domains (e.g., driving, where a driving instructor may provide advice such as ""keep a certain distance from the car in front"").

Why would the learned features (building blocks) necessarily semantically meaningful?  In the motivating example of text, rather than discovering letters, features could correspond to many other sub-units (parts of letters), or other features lacking direct semantic meaning.

The current instantiation of the model is limited.  It models binary image patterns.  The experiments are done on synthetic data and MNIST digits.  The method recovers the structure and is effective at classification on synthetic data that are directly compositional.  On the MNIST data, the test errors are quite large, and worse than a CNN except when synthetic data corruption is added.  Further work to enhance the ability of the method to handle natural images or naturally occuring data variation would enhance the paper.",,4.0,4.0

The paper presents a novel technique for extracting interpretable hierarchical template representations based on a small set of standard operations.

This insight is then used to formulate a message passing technique which was shown to produce accurate results for these types of problems.

Summary:
———
The paper presents an novel formulation for extracting hierarchical template representations that has not been discussed in that form. Unfortunately the experimental results are on smaller scale data and extension of the proposed algorithm to more natural images seems non-trivial to me.

Quality: I think some of the techniques could be described more carefully to better convey the intuition.
Clarity: Some of the derivations and intuitions could be explained in more detail.
Originality: The suggested idea is reasonable but limited to binary data at this point in time.
Significance: Since the experimental setup is somewhat limited according to my opinion, significance is hard to judge.

1. My main concern is related to the experimental evaluation. While the discussed approach is valuable, its application seems limited to binary images at this point in time. Can the authors comment?

2. There are existing techniques to extract representations of images which the authors may want to mention, e.g., work based on grammars.",,5.0,4.0
670,False,Hierarchical compositional feature learning,"This paper presents an approach to learn object representations by composing a set of templates which are leaned from binary images. 
In particular, a hierarchical model is learned by combining AND, OR and POOL operations. Learning is performed by using approximated inference with MAX-product BP follow by a heuristic to threshold activations to be binary. 

Learning hierarchical representations that are interpretable is a very interesting topic, and this paper brings some good intuitions in light of modern convolutional neural nets. 

I have however, some concerns about the paper:

1) the paper fails to cite and discuss relevant literature and claims to be the first one that is able to learn interpretable parts. 
I would like to see a discussion of the proposed approach compared to a variety of papers e.g.,:

- Compositional hierarchies of Sanja Fidler
- AND-OR graphs used by Leo Zhu and Alan Yuille to model objects
- AND-OR templates of Song-Chun Zhu's group at UCLA 

The claim that this paper is the first to discover such parts should be removed. 

2) The experimental evaluation is limited to very toy datasets. The papers I mentioned have been applied to real images (e.g., by using contours to binarize the images). 
I'll also like to see how good/bad the proposed approach is for classification in more well known benchmarks. 
A comparison to other generative models such as VAE, GANS, etc will also be useful.

3) I'll also like to see a discussion of the relation/differences/advantages of the proposed approach wrt to sum product networks and grammars.

Other comments:

- the paper claims that after learning inference is feed-forward, but since message passing is used, it should be a recurrent network. 

- the algorithm and tech discussion should be moved from the appendix to the main paper

- the introduction claims that compression is a prove for understanding. I disagree with this statement, and should be removed. 

- I'll also like to see a discussion relating the proposed approach to the Deep Rendering model. 

- It is not obvious how some of the constraints are satisfied during message passing. Also constraints are well known to be difficult to optimize with max product. How do you handle this?

- The learning and inference algorithms seems to be very heuristic (e.g., clipping to 1, heuristics on which messages are run). Could you analyze the choices you make?

- doing multiple steps of 5) 2) is not a single backward pass

671,True,FractalNet: Ultra-Deep Neural Networks without Residuals,"This paper proposes a design principle for computation blocks in convolutional networks based on repeated application of expand and join operations resulting in a fractal-like structure. 

This paper is primarily about experimental evaluation, since the objective is to show that a residual formulation is not necessary to obtain good performance, at least on some tasks.

However, in my opinion the evaluations in the paper are not convincing. The primary issue is lack of a proper baseline, against which the improvements can be clearly demonstrated by making isolated changes. I understand that for this paper such a baseline is hard to construct, since it is about a novel architecture principle. This is why more effort should be put into this, so that core insights from this paper can be useful even after better performing architectures are discovered.
The number of parameters and amount of computation should be used to indicate how fair the comparisons are between architectures. Some detailed comments:

- In Table 1 comparisons to Resnets, the resnets from He et al. 2016b and Wide Resnets should be compared to FractalNet (in lieu of a proper baseline). The first outperforms FractalNet on CIFAR-100 while the second outperforms it on both. The authors compare to other results without augmentation, but did not perform additional experiments without augmentation for these architectures.

- The 40 layer Fractal Net should not be compared to other models unless the parameter reduction tricks are utilized for the other models as well.

- A proper comparison to Inception networks should also be performed for these networks. My guess is that the reason behind a seemingly 'ad-hoc' design of Inception modules is to reduce the computational footprint of the model (which is not a central motivation of fractal nets). Since this model is directly related to the Inception module due to use of shorter and longer paths without shortcuts, one can easily simplify the Inception design to build a strong baseline e.g. by converting the concatenation operation to a mean operation among equally sized convolution outputs. As an aside, note that Inception networks have already shown that residual networks are not necessary to obtain the best performance [1].

- It should be noted that Residual/Highway architectures do have a type of anytime property, as shown by lesioning experiments in Srivastava et al and Viet et al.

- The architecture specific drop-path regularization is interesting, but is used along with other regularizers such as dropout, batch norm and weight decay and its benefit on its own is not clear.

Overall, it's not clear to me that the experiments clearly demonstrate the utility of the proposed architecture.

- the idea is novel

- the experimental evaluation is not convincing, e.g. no improvement on SVHN
- number of parameters should be mentioned for all models for fair comparison
- the effect of drop-path seems to vanish with data augmentation",,6.0,4.0
673,True,FractalNet: Ultra-Deep Neural Networks without Residuals,"This paper proposes a new architecture that does not explicitly use residuals but constructs an architecture that is composed of networks with fractal structure by using expand and join operations. Using the fractal architecture,  authors argue and try to demonstrate that the large nominal network depth with many short paths is the key for 'training 'ultra-deep” networks while residuals are incidental.

The main bottleneck of this paper is that number of parameters needed for the FractalNet is significantly higher than the baselines which makes it hard to scale to ''ultra-deep” networks.  Authors replied that Wide ResNets also require many parameters but this is not the case for ResNet and other ResNet variants. ResNet and ResNet with Stochastic depth scales to depth of 110 with 1.7M parameters and to depth of 1202 with 10.2M parameters which is much less than the number of parameters for depths of 20 and 40 in Table 1(Huang et al, 2016a).   It is not clear whether FractalNet can perform better than these depths with a reasonable computation. Authors report less parameters for 40 layers but this scaling trick is not validated for other depths including depth 20 in Table 1. On the other hand, the number of parameters for 40 layers with scaling trick is clearly still large compared to most of the baselines. Unsatisfactory comparison to these baselines makes the claims of authors unconvincing.

Authors also claim that drop-path to provide improvement compared to layer dropping procedure in Huang et al, 2016b however the results show that the empirical gain of this specific regularization disappears when well-known data augmentation techniques applied. Therefore the empirical effectiveness of drop-path is not convincing too.

DenseNets (Huang et al, 2016a) should be also included in the comparison since it outperforms most of the state of art Res Nets on both CIFAR10 and ImageNet and more importantly outperforms the proposed FractalNet significantly and it requires significantly less computation. 

Table 1 has Res-Net variants as baselines however Table 2 has only ResNet.  Therefore ImageNet comparison only shows that one can run FractalNet on ImageNet and can perform comparably well to ResNet which is not a satisfactory result given the improvements of other baselines over ResNet.  In addition, there is no improvement in SVHN dataset results and this is not discussed in the empirical analysis.

Also, authors give a list of some improvements over Inception (Szegedy et al., 2015) but again these intuitive claims about effectiveness of these changes are not supported with any empirical analysis. 

Although the paper attempts to explore many interesting intuitive directions using the proposed architecture, the empirical results are not support the given claims and the large number of parameters makes the model restrictive in practice hence the contribution does not seem to be significant. 

Pros:
Provides an interesting architecture compared to ResNet and its variants and investigates the differences to residual networks which can stimulate some other promising analysis

cons:
     -    Number of parameters are very large compared to baselines that can have even much higher depths with smaller number of parameters
The claims are intuitive but not supported well with empirical evidence

675,False,Cooperative Training of Descriptor and Generator Networks,"This paper proposed a new joint training scheme for two probabilistic models of signals (e.g. images) which are both deep neural network based and are termed generator and descriptor networks.  In the new scheme, termed cooperative training, the two networks train together and assist each other: the generator network provides samples that work as initial samples for the descriptor network, and the descriptor network updates those samples to help guide training of the generator network.

This is an interesting approach for coupling the training of these two models.  The paper however is quite weak on the empirical studies.  In particular:
- The training datasets are tiny, from sets of 1 image to 5-6.  What is the reason for not using larger sets?  I think the small datasets are leading to over training and are really masking the true value of the proposed cooperative training approach.
- For most of the experiments presented in the paper it is hard to assess the specific value brought by the proposed cooperative training approach because baseline results are missing.  There are comparisons provided for face completion experiments - but even there comparisons with descriptor or generator network trained separately or with other deep auto-encoders are missing.  Thus it is hard to conclude if and how much gain is obtained by cooperative training over say individually training the descriptor and generator networks.

Another comment is that in the “related work” section, I think relation with variational auto encoders (Kingma and Welling 2013) should be included.

Despite limitations mentioned above, I think the ideas presented in the paper are intuitively appealing and worth discussing at ICLR.  Paper would be considerably strengthened by adding more relevant baselines and addressing the training data size issues.",,6.0,4.0
676,False,Cooperative Training of Descriptor and Generator Networks,"The authors proposes an interesting idea of connecting the energy-based model (descriptor) and 
the generator network to help each other. The samples from the generator are used as the initialization 
of the descriptor inference. And the revised samples from the descriptor is in turn used to update
the generator as the target image. 

The proposed idea is interesting. However, I think the main flaw is that the advantages of having that 
architecture are not convincingly demonstrated in the experiments. For example, readers will expect 
quantative analysis on how initializing with the samples from the generator helps? Also, the only 
quantative experiment on the reconstruction is also compared to quite old models. Considering that 
the model is quite close to the model of Kim & Bengio 2016, readers would also expect a comparison 
to that model.

677,False,Iterative Refinement for Machine Translation,"This work proposes to iteratively improve a sentence that has been generated from another MT system (in this case, a phrase-based system). The authors use a neural net that takes in the source sentence and a window of (gold) words around the current target word, and predicts the current target word. During testing, the gold words are replaced with the generated words. While this is an interesting area of research, I am not convinced by the proposed approach, and experimental evidence is lacking.

Under the current framework, it is all but impossible for the model to do anything more than a rudimentary word replacement (e.g. it cannot change ""I went to the fridge even though I was not hungry"" to ""Although I was not hungry, I went to the fridge""). The fact that only 0.6 words are edited on average supports this. 

Specific comments:
- It would be interesting to see what the improvements are if the baseline model is a neural system.
- It seems strange (to me at least) that T^i and L(y^{-i|k}) only look at a window of 2k words. It means that when making the decision to change the i-th word, the model does not know what was generated outside of the window? 
- Relatedly, the idea of changing individual words based on local (i.e. word-level) scores seems counterintuitive. Given that we have the full generated sentence, don't we want a global score? Scoring at the sentence-level could also make room for non-greedy search strategies, which could potentially facilitate richer edits.
- How does the approach compare to a model that simply re-ranks the k-best output?
- Instead of editing, did you consider learning an encoder-decoder that takes in x, y_g, and generates y_ref? When decoding you can attend to both x and y_g.

678,False,Iterative Refinement for Machine Translation,"This paper proposes a method for iteratively improving the output of an existing machine translation by identifying potential mistakes and proposing a substitution, in this case using an attention-based model.  It is motivated by the method in which (it is assumed) human translators operate.

The paper is interesting and imaginative.  However, in general terms, I am somewhat sceptical of this kind of approach -- whereby a machine learning method is used to identify and correct the predictions of another method, or itself -- because in the first case, if the new method is better, why not use it from the outset in place of the other method?  And in the second case, since the method has no new information compared to previously, why is it more likely to identify more past mistakes and correct them, than identify past correct terms and turn them into new errors?  That is unless there is a specific reason that an iterative approach can be shown to converge to a better solution when run over several epochs.

This paper does not convince me on these points.  Indeed, unsurprisingly, the authors note that ""the probability of correctly labelling a word as a mistake remains low (62%)"" - this admittedly beats a random-chance baseline, but is not compared to something more meaningful, such as simply contrasting the existing system with a more powerful convolutional model and labelling all discrepancies as mistakes.  The oracle experiments are rather meaningless - they just serve to confirm that improving a translation is very easy when the existing mistakes have been identified, but much harder when they are not. 

Although I do like the paper on the whole, to really convince me that main objective -- ie. that **iterative** improvement is beneficial -- has been satifactorily demonstrated it would be necessary to include stronger baselines - and in particular, to show that an iterative refinement scheme can really improve over a system closely matched to the attention-based model, both when used in isolation and when used in system combination with a PBMT system, and to demonstrate that the PBMT system is not simply acting as a regulariser for the attention-based model.

Minor comments:

I find the notation excessively fiddly at times - eg F^i = (F^{i,1}, F^{i,|F^i|}) - why use |F^i| here when F is a matrix, so surely the length of the slice is not dependent on i?

In the discussion in section 4 - it seems that this still creates a mismatch between the training and test conditions - could anything be done about this?

679,False,Iterative Refinement for Machine Translation,"This paper proposes a model for iteratively refining translation hypotheses. This has several benefits, including enabling the translation model to condition not only on “left context”, but also on “right context”, and potentially enabling more rapid and/or accurate decoding. The motivation given is that often translators (and text generators generally) use a process of refinement in generating outputs.

This is an important idea that is not currently playing much of a role in neural net models, so this paper is a welcome contribution. However, while I think this is an important first step, I do feel that the lack of in depth analysis suggests this paper is not quite ready for a final publication version. For example, there are many possible connections to prior work in NLP, MT, and other parts of ML that could better contextualize this work (see specifics below). More substantively, the model in Section 3 could be interpreted as a globally normalized, undirected (~CRF) translation model trained using a pseudo-likelihood objective. In this analysis, the model squarely back in the context of traditional discriminative translation models which used “undirected” features, and the decoding algorithm then looks more like a standard greedy hill-climbing algorithm (albeit with an extra heuristic model for selecting which variable to update), which is also nothing unfamiliar.

My second criticism the limitations of the model are not well discussed. For example, the proposed editing procedure cannot obviously remove or insert a word from a translation. While I think this is a reasonable assumption than can be made for the sake of tractability, it is very unfortunate since missing or extra words (esp. function words) are a common problem in the baseline models that are being used. Second, the standard objections to absolute positional models (vs. relative positional models) seem particularly crucial to bring up in this work, especially since they might make some of the design decisions a bit more justifiable.

Overall, this is an initial step in an interesting direction, but it needs more thorough analysis to demonstrate its value. A more thorough analysis will also likely suggest some important model variants (for example: is a global translation model really the goal? or is a post-editing model that fixes outputs with more complex operations more ideal?)

Related work:
I think that more could be done to put this work in the context of what has come before and what is currently going on in other parts of ML. The idea of iterative refinement has been proposed in other problems that have complex output spaces, for example the DRAW model of Gregor et al. and the conditional adversarial network models used to refine images proposed recently by Isola et al. In NLP, there have been several (stochastic) hill climbing approaches that have been proposed, such as the work on parsing by Zhang and Lei et al. (2014) who use random initial guesses and then do greedy hill climbing using a series of local refinements, the structured prediction cascades of Weiss and Taskar (2009) (not to mention general coarse-to-fine modeling strategies). Finally, in MT, Arun et al. (2009) who use a Gibbs sampler to refine an initial guess to do decoding with a more complex model. The use of an explicit error model is rather novel in the context of correction, but I would point out that although the proposed architecture is different, the discriminative word lexicon models of Mauser et al. (2009) and the neural version of the same by Ha et al. (2014) are similar in spirit. There have also been a number of papers on “automatic post editing”, including the shared task at WMT2016, and there are not only standard test sets and baselines, but also datasets that could actually be used to train a post editing model with human-generated data. Minimally using the techniques they described could be a useful foil for the models presented in this paper.

“the target sentence is also embedded in distributional space via a lookup table” I think “distributional space” is a bit unclear. Maybe “the target sentence is represented in terms of distributed word representations via a lookup table” or something like that. “distributional” suggests that the representations are derived from how the words are distributed in the corpus, whereas you are learning these representations on this task which isn’t modeling their distribution except only very indirectly.

Section 3 Model: In Section 3, the model computes the distribution over target word types at an absolute position i in the output sentence, given the target language context and the source language context. It is introduced as the model that is used to refine an existing hypothesis, but it is not immediately clear that the training data for this model (at least in this section) are the gold standard translations- “training set” could be interpreted in variety of ways. This becomes clearer when reading later in the paper, but it’s a bit less clear when reading from the beginning for the first time.

The use of a fixed sized window for representing the target word in context also seems to make something like a model 1 assumption since only the lexical features (and not any “alignment” or “positional” features) determine the attention. This should be clarified since it will make the assumptions of the model more transparent (and also suggest possible refinements to the model, e.g., including (representations) of i and j as components of S^j and T^i, which would allow model 2/3-like responses to be learned- although by leaving them out, the model might behave a bit more like a relative positional model than an absolute positional model, which is probably attractive).

Finally, some discussion for why a fixed window is used to represent the target sentence is worth including (since a global context is apparently used to represent the source sentence).

The relationship between this training objective and pseudo likelihood (PL; Besag, 1975) might be worth mentioning. Since I believe this is just a PL objective for a certain global model, this suggests alternative decoding algorithms, or certainly a different analysis of the proposed decoding objective.

The section 4 model conditions on the true context of a position in the true target, the current target guess, and the source. I don’t completely understand the rationale for this model since at test time only two of these variables are available, and the replacement of y_ref with y_g seems hard to justify.",,5.0,5.0

Summary: A human translator does not come up with the final translation right

It is my opinion however that drawings illustrating the architectures would help

intuition of how difficult the task is. You should highlight the links

of iterative refinement. Could you use post-edited text to have a more
solid ground-truth?

My main concern with this paper is that in the experimental section the 
iterative approach tries to improve upon only one type of machine translation. 
Which immediately prompts these questions:
- why did they choose that approach to improve on?
- what is the part of the improvement that comes from the choice of the
  initial draft (maybe it was a very bad draft)?

681,False,Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Steganography,"This paper proposes an interesting application of the GAN framework in steganography domain. In addition to the normal GAN discriminator, there is a steganalyser discriminator that receives the negative examples from the generator and positive examples from the generator images that contain a hidden payload. As a result, the generator, not only learn to generate realistic images by fooling the discriminator of the GAN, but also learn to be a secure container by fooling steganalyser discriminator. The method is tested by training an independent steganalyser S* on real images and generated images.

Given that in the ICLR community, not many people are familiar with the literature of steganography, I think this paper should have provided more context about how exactly this method can be used in practice, what are the related works on setganalysis-secure message embedding and probably a more thorough sets of experiments on more than one dataset.

The proposed SGAN framework (Figure 2) does make sense to me, and I think it is very general and can have more applications other than the steganography domain. But it is not clear to me why fooling the steganalyser discriminator S, necessarily mean that we can fool an independent discriminator S*?

Also I find it surprising that a different seed value, can make such a huge difference in the accuracy.

I found eq. 4 interesting because it introduces a potentially non-differentiable black-box function Stego(...) into the training of (S, G). Do you in fact backprop through the Stego function?

- For the train/test split, why is the SGAN trained on all 200k images? Would it not be cleaner to use the same splits for training SGAN as for ""steganalysis purposes""? Could this account for the sensitivity to random seed shown in table 2?
- Sec. 5.3: ""Steganographic Generative Adversarial Networks can potentially be used as a universal tool for generating Steganography containers tuned to deceive any specific steganalysis algorithm."". This experiment showed that SGAN can fool HUGO, but I do not see how it was ""tuned"" to deceive HUGO, or how it could be tuned in general for a particular steganalyzer.

Although S* seems to be fooled by the proposed method, in general for image generation the discriminator D is almost never fooled. I.e. contemporary GANs never converge to actually fooling the discriminator, even if they produce samples that sometimes fool humans. What if I created an additional steganalyzer S**(x) = S*(x) * D(x)? This I think would be extremely difficult to fool reliably because it requires realistic image generation.

After reading the paper several times, it is still a bit unclear to me how or why precisely one would use a trained SGAN. I think the paper could be greatly improved by detailing, step by step, the workflow of how a hypothetical user would use a trained SGAN.

683,True,A Compositional Object-Based Approach to Learning Physical Dynamics,"- summary

The paper proposes a differntiable Neural Physics Engine (NPE). The NPE consists of an encoder and a decoder function. The NPE takes as input the state of pairs of objects (within a neighbourhood of a focus object) at two previous time-steps in a scene. The encoder function summarizes the interaction of each pair of objects. The decoder then outputs the change in velocity of the focus object at the next time step. The NPE is evaluated on various environments containing bouncing balls.

- novelty

The differentiable NPE is a novel concept. However, concurrently Battaglia et al. (NIPS 2016) proposes a very similar model. Just as this work, Battaglia et al. (NIPS 2016) consider a model which consists of a encoder function (relation-centric) which encodes the interaction among a focus object and other objects in the scene and a decoder (relation-centric) function which considers the cumulative (encoded) effect of object interactions on the focus object and predicts effect of the interactions.  Aspects like only considering objects interactions within a neighbourhood (versus the complete object interaction graph in Battaglia et al.) based on euclideian distance  are novel to this work. However, the advantages (if any) of NPE versus the model of Battaglia et al. are not clear. Moreover, it is not clear how this neighbourhood thresholding scene would preform in case of n-ball systems, where gravitational forces of massive objects can be felt over large distances.

The article is well written and easy to understand.

- experiments 

Battaglia et al. evaluates on wider variety senerios compared to this work (e.g. n-bodies under gravitation, falling strings). Such experiments demonstrate the ability of the models to generalize. However, this work does include more in-depth experiments in case of bouncing balls compared to Battaglia et al. (e.g. mass estimation and varying world configurations with obstacles in the bouncing balls senerio). 

Moreover, an extensive comparison to Fragkiadaki et al. (2015) (in the bouncing balls senerios) is missing. The authors (referring to answer to question 4) do point out to comaprable numbers in both works, but the experimental settings are different.  Comparison in a billiard table senerio like that Fragkiadaki et al. (2015) where a initial force is applied to a ball, would have been enlightening. 

The authors only evaluate the error in velocity in the bouncing balls senerios. We understand that this model predicts only the velocity (refer to answer of question 2). Error analysis also with respect to ground truth ball position would be more enlightening. As small errors in velocity can quickly lead to entirely different scene configuration.

- conclusion / recommendation

The main issue with this work is the unclear novelty with respect to work of Battaglia et al. at NIPS'16. A quantitative and qualitative comparison with Battaglia et al. is lacking.  But the authors state that their work was developed independently.

Differentiable physics engines like NPE or that of Battaglia et al. (NIPS 2016) requires generation of an extensive amount of synthetic data to learn about the physics of a certain senerio. Moreover, extensive retraining is required to adapt to new sceneries (e.g. bouncing balls to n-body systems). Any practical advantage versus generating new code for a physics engine is not clear. Other ""bottom-up"" approaches like that of  Fragkiadaki et al. (2015) couple vision along with learning dynamics. However, they require very few input parameters (position, mass, current velocity, world configuration), as approximate parameter estimation can be done from the visual component.  Such approaches could be potentially more useful of a robot in ""common-sense"" everyday tasks (e.g. manipulation). Thus, overall potential applications of a differentiable physics engine like NPE is unclear.",,6.0,4.0
684,True,A Compositional Object-Based Approach to Learning Physical Dynamics,"Summary
===
This paper proposes the Neural Physics Engine (NPE), a network architecture
which simulates object interactions. While NPE decides to explicitly represent
objects (rather than video frames), it incorporates knowledge of physics
almost exclusively through training data. It is tested in a toy domain with
bouncing 2d balls.

The proposed architecture processes each object in a scene one at a time.
Pairs of objects are embedded in a common space where the effect of the
objects on each other can be represented. These embeddings are summed
and combined with the focus object's state to predict the focus object's
change in velocity. Alternative baselines are presented which either
forego the pairwise embedding for a single object embedding or
encode a focus object's neighbors in a sequence of LSTM states.

NPE outperforms the baselines dramatically, showing the importance of
architecture choices in learning to do this object based simulation.
The model is tested in multiple ways. Ability to predict object trajectory
over long time spans is measured. Generalization to different numbers of objects
is measured. Generalization to slightly altered environments (difference
shaped walls) is measured. Finally, the NPE is also trained to predict
object mass using only interactions with other objects, where it also
outperforms baselines.


Comments
===

* I have one more clarifying question. Are the inputs to the blue box in
figure 3 (b)/(c) the concatenation of the summed embeddings and state vector
of object 3? Or is the input to the blue module some other combination of the
two vectors?


* Section 2.1 begins with ""First, because physics does not
change across inertial frames, it suffices to separately predict the future state of each object conditioned
on the past states of itself and the other objects in its neighborhood, similar to Fragkiadaki
et al. (2015).""

I think this is an argument to forego the visual representation used by previous
work in favor of an object only representation. This would be more clear if there
were contrast with a visual representation.


* As addressed in the paper, this approach is novel, though less so after taking
into consideration the concurrent work of Battaglia et. al. in NIPS 2016 titled
""Interaction Networks for Learning about Objects, Relations and Physics.""
This work offers a different network architecture and set of experiments, as
well as great presentation, but the use of an object based representation
for learning to predict physical behavior is shared.


Overall Evaluation
===

This paper was a pleasure to read and provided many experiments that offered
clear and interesting conclusions. It offers a novel approach (though
less so compared to the concurrent work of Battaglia et. al. 2016) which
represents a significant step forward in the current investigation of
intuitive physics.",,9.0,4.0
685,True,A Compositional Object-Based Approach to Learning Physical Dynamics,"Paper proposes a neural physics engine (NPE). NPE provides a factorization of physical scene into composable object-based representations. NPE predicts a future state of the given object as a function composition of the pairwise interactions between itself and near-by objects. This has a nice physical interpretation of forces being additive. In the paper NPE is investigated in the context of 2D worlds with balls and obstacles. 

Overall the approach is interesting and has an interesting flavor of combining neural networks with basic properties of physics. Overall, it seems like it may lead to interesting and significant follow up work in the field. The concerns with the paper is mainly with evaluation, which in places appears to be weak (see below). 

> Significance & Originality:

The approach is interesting. While other methods have tried to build models that can deal with physical predictions, the idea of summing over pair-wise terms, to the best of my knowledge, is novel and much more in-line with the underlying principles of mechanics. As such, while relatively simple, it seems to be an important contribution. 

> Clarity:

The paper is generally well written. However, large portion of the early introduction is rather abstract and it is difficult to parse until one gets to 5th paragraph. I would suggest editing the early part of introduction to include more specifics about the approach or even examples ... to make text more tangible.

> Experiments

Generally there are two issues with experiments in my opinion: (1) the added indirect comparison with Fragkiadaki et al (2015) does not appears to be quantitatively flattering with respect to the proposed approach, and (2) quantitative experiments on the role the size of the mask has on performance should really be added. Authors mention that they observe that mask is helpful, but it is not clear how helpful or how sensitive the overall performance is to this parameter. This experiment should really be added.

I do feel that despite few mentioned shortcomings that would make the paper stronger, this is an interesting paper and should be published.",,7.0,4.0
686,False,Transformational Sparse Coding,"A new sparse coding model is introduced that learns features jointly with their transformations. It is found that inference over per-image transformation variables is hard, so the authors suggest tying these variables across all data points, turning them into global parameters, and using multiple transformations for each feature. Furthermore, it is suggested to use a tree of transformations, where each path down the tree generates a feature by multiplying the root feature by the transformations associated with the edges. The one-layer tree model achieves similar reconstruction error as traditional sparse coding, while using fewer parameters.

This is a nice addition to the literature on sparse coding and the literature on learning transformation models. The authors identify and deal with a difficult inference problem that can occur in transformation models. That said, I am skeptical about the usefulness of the general approach. The authors take it as a given that “learning sparse features and transformations jointly” is an important goal in itself, but this is never really argued or demonstrated with experiments. It doesn’t seem like this method enables new applications, extends our understanding of learning what/where pathways in the brain, or improve our ability to model natural images.

The authors claim that the model extracts pose information, but although the model explicitly captures the transformation that relates different features in a tree, at test time, inference is only performed over the (sparse) coefficient associated with each (feature, transformation) combination, just like in sparse coding. It is not clear what we gain by knowing that each coefficient is associated with a transformation, especially since there are many models that do this general “what / where” split.

It would be good to check that the x_{v->b} actually change significantly from their initialization values. The loss surface still looks pretty bad even for tied transformations, so they may actually not move much. Does the proposed model work better according to some measure, compared to a model where x_{v->b} are fixed and chosen from some reasonable range of parameter values (either randomly or spaced evenly)?

One of the conceptually interesting aspects of the paper is the idea of a tree of transformations, but the advantage of deeper trees is never demonstrated convincingly. It looks like the authors have only just gotten this approach to work on toy data with vertical and horizontal bars.

Finally, it is not clear how the method could be extended to have multiple layers. The transformation operators T can be defined in the first layer because they act on the input space, but the same cannot be done in the learned feature space. It is also not clear how the pose information should be further processed in a hierarchical manner, or how learning in a deep version should work.

In summary, I do not recommend this paper for publication, because it is not clear what problem is being solved, the method is only moderately novel and the novel aspects are not convincingly shown to be beneficial.",,4.0,4.0
687,False,Transformational Sparse Coding,"This paper trains a generative model of image patches, where dictionary elements undergo gated linear transformations before being combined. The transformations are motivated in terms of Lie group operators, though in practice they are a set of fixed linear transformations. This is motivated strongly in terms of learning a hierarchy of transformations, though only one layer is used in the experiments (except for a toy case in the appendix).

I like the motivation for this algorithm. The realization seems very similar to a group or block sparse coding implementation. I was disappointed by the restriction to linear transformations. The experiments were all toy cases, demonstrating that the algorithm can learn groups of Gabor- or center surround-like features. They would have been somewhat underpowered five years ago, and seemed extremely small by today's standards.

Specific comments:

Based on common practices in ML literature, I have a strong bias to think of $x$ as inputs and $w$ as network weights. Latent variables are often $z$ or $a$. Depending on your target audience, I would suggest permuting your choice of symbols so the reader can more quickly interpret your model.

nit: number all equations for easier reference

sec 2.2 -- It's weird that the transformation is fixed, but is still written as a function of x.

sec 2.3 -- The updated text here confuses me actually. I had thought that you were using a fixed set of linear transformations, and were motivating in terms of Lie groups, but were not actually taking matrix exponentials in your algorithm. The equations in the second half of this section suggest you are working with matrix exponentials though. I'm not sure which direction I'm confused in, but probably good to clarify the text either way.

BTW -- there's another possible solution to the local minima difficulty, which is the one used in Sohl-Dickstein, 2010. There, they introduce blurring operators matched to each transformation operator, and gradient descent can escape local minima by detouring through coarser (more blurred) scales.

sec 3.2 -- I believe by degrees of freedom you mean the number of model parameters, not the number of latent coefficients that must be inferred? Should make this more clear. Is it more appropriate to compare reconstruction error while matching number of model parameters, or number of latent variables?

I wonder if a convolutional version of this algorithm would be practical / would make it more suited as a generative model of whole images.

post rebuttal update

Thank you for taking the time to write the rebuttal! I have read it, but it did not significantly effect my rating.",,5.0,4.0
688,False,Transformational Sparse Coding,"This paper proposes an approach to unsupervised learning based on a modification to sparse coding that allows for explicit modeling of transformations (such as shift, rotation, etc.), as opposed to simple pooling as is typically done in convnets.  Results are shown for training on natural images, demonstrating that the algorithm learns about features and their transformations in the data.  A comparison to traditional sparse coding shows that it represents images with fewer degrees of freedom.

This seems like a good and interesting approach, but the work seems like its still in its early formative stages rather than a complete work with a compelling punch line.  For example one of the motivations is that you'd like to represent pose along with the identity of an object.  While this work seems well on its way to that goal, it doesn't quite get there - it leaves a lot of dots still to be connected.  

Also there are a number of things that aren't clear in the paper:

o The central idea of the paper it seems is the use of a transformational sparse coding tree to make tractable the inference of the Lie group parameters x_k.  But how exactly this is done is not at all clear.  For example, the sentence: ""The main idea is to gradually marginalize over an increasing range of transformations,"" is suggestive but not clear.  This needs to be much better defined.  What do you mean by marginalization in this context?  

 o The connection between the Lie group operator and the tree leaves and weights w_b is not at all clear.   The learning rule spells out the gradient for the Lie group operator, but how this is used to learn the leaves of the tree is not clear.  A lot is left to the imagination here.  This is especially confusing because although the Lie group operator is introduced earlier, it is then stated that its not tractable for inference because there are too many local minima, and this motivates the tree approach instead.  So its not clear why you are learning the Lie group operator.

 o It is stated that ""Averaging over many data points, smoothens the surface of the error function.""  I don't understand why you would average over many data points.  It seems each would have its own transformation, no?

 o What data do you train on?  How is it generated?  Do you generate patches with known transformations and then show that you can recover them?  Please explain.

The results shown in Figure 4 look very interesting, but given the lack of clarity in the above, difficult to interpret and understand what this means, and its significance.

I would encourage the authors to rewrite the paper more clearly and also to put more work into further developing these ideas, which seem very promising.

Thank you for your comments and suggestions. We uploaded a new version of the paper to address them:

3) We added a formal definition of deeper trees and added a small example that shows learned structure.

4) We added more figures of learned features.

5) We changed our regularization. Instead of regularizing derivative features, we constrain root features to be of unit
norm and penalize transformations that change the magnitude. Inter- and intra- tree regularization is no longer required
and we can use the feature-sign algorithm to infer the weights.

",,5.0,4.0
692,True,Multi-view Recurrent Neural Acoustic Word Embeddings,"This paper proposes an approach to learning word vector representations for character sequences and acoustic spans jointly. The paper is clearly written and both the approach and experiments seem reasonable in terms of execution. The motivation and tasks feel a bit synthetic as it requires acoustics spans for words that have already been segmented from continuous speech - - a major assumption. The evaluation tasks feel a bit synthetic overall and in particular when evaluating character based comparisons it seems there should also be phoneme based comparisons.

There's a lot of discussion of character edit distance relative to acoustic span similarity. It seems very natural to also include phoneme string edit distance in this discussion and experiments. This is especially true of the word similarity test. Rather than only looking at levenshtein edit distance of characters you should evaluate edit distance of the phone strings relative to the acoustic embedding distances. Beyond the evaluation task the paper would be more interesting if you compared character embeddings with phone string embeddings. I believe the last function could remain identical it's just swapping out characters for phones as the symbol set.  finally in this topic the discussion and experiments should look at homophones As if not obvious what the network would learn to handle these.

 the vocabulary size and training data amount make this really a toy problem. although there are many pairs constructed most of those pairs will be easy distinctions. the experiments and conclusions would be far stronger with a larger vocabulary and word segment data set with subsampling all pairs perhaps biased towards more difficult or similar pairs.

 it seems this approach is unable to address the task of keyword spotting in longer spoken utterances. If that's the case please add some discussion as to why you are solving the problem of word embeddings given existing word segmentations. The motivating example of using this approach to retrieve words seems flawed if a recognizer must be used to segment words beforehand ",,6.0,4.0
693,True,Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models,"This work is an extension of previous works on pointer models, that mixes its outputs with standard softmax outputs. 
The idea is appealing in general for context biasing and the specific approach appears quite simple.

The idea is novel to some extent, as previous paper had already tried to combine pointer-based and standard models,
but not as a mixture model, as in this paper.

The paper is clearly written and the results seem promising.
The new dataset the authors created (WikiText) also seems of high interest. 

A comment regarding notation:
The symbol p_ptr is used in two different ways in eq. 3 and eq. 5. : p_ptr(w) vs. p_ptr(y_i|x_i) 
This is confusing as these are two different domains: for eq 3. the domain is a *set* of words and for eq. 5 the domain is a *list* of context words.
It would be helpful to use different symbol for the two objects.",,8.0,4.0
694,True,Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models,"This paper proposes augmenting RNN-based language models with a pointer network in order to deal better with rare words. The pointer network can point to words in the recent context, and hence the prediction for each time step is a mixture between the usual softmax output and the pointer distribution over the recent words. The paper also introduces a new language modelling dataset, which overcomes some of the shortcomings of previous datasets.

The reason for the score I gave for this paper is that I find the proposed model a direct application of the previous work Gulcehre et al., which follows a similar approach but for machine translation and summarization. The main differences I find is that Gulcehre et al. use an encoder-decoder architecture, and use the attention weights of the encoder to point to locations of words in the input, while here an RNN is used and a pointer network produces a distribution over the full vocabulary (by summing the softmax probabilities of words in the recent context). The context (query) vector for the pointing network is also different, but this is also a direct consequence of having a different application.

While the paper describes the differences between the proposed approach and Gulcehre et al.’s approach, I find some of the claims either wrong or not that significant. For example, quoting from Section 1:
“Rather than relying on the RNN hidden state to decide when to use the pointer, as in the recent work of Gulcehre et al. (2016), we allow the pointer component itself to decide when to use the softmax vocabulary through a sentinel.”
As far as I can tell, your model also uses the recent hidden state to form a query vector,  which is matched by the pointer network to previous words. Can you please clarify what you mean here?

In addition, quoting from section 3 which describes the model of Gulcehre et al.:
“Rather than constructing a mixture model as in our work, they use a switching network to decide which component to use”
This is not correct. The model of Gulcehre is also a mixture model, where an MLP with sigmoid output (switching network) is used to form a mixture between softmax prediction and locations of the input text.

Finally, in the following quote, also from section 3: 
“The pointer network is not used as a source of information for the switching network as in our model.” 
It is not clear what the authors mean by “source of information” here. Is it the fact that the switching probability is part of the pointer softmax? I am wondering how significant this difference is.

With regards to the proposed dataset, there are also other datasets typically used for language modelling, including The Hutter Prize Wikipedia (enwik8) dataset (Hutter, 2012) and e Text8 dataset (Mahoney, 2009). Can you please comment on the differences between your dataset and those as well?

695,True,Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models,"This work is basically a combined pointer network applied on language modelling. 
The smart point is that this paper aims at language modelling with longer context, where a memory of seen words (especially the rare words) would be very useful for predicting the rest of the sentences. 
Hence, a combination of a pointer network and a standard language model would balance the copying seen words and predicting unseen words. 

Generally, such as the combined pointer networks applied in sentence compression, a vector representation of the source sequence would be used to compute the gate. 
This paper, instead, introduces a sentinel vector to carry out the mixture model, which is suitable in the case of language modelling. 
I would be interested in the variations of sentinel mixture implementation, though the current version has achieved very good results. 

In addition, the new WikiText language modelling dataset is very interesting. 
It probably can be a more standard dataset for evaluating the continuously-updated language model benchmarks than ptb dataset.

-----

This manuscript proposes to tackle few-shot learning with neural networks by leveraging meta-learning, a classic idea that has seen a renaissance in the last 12 months. The authors formulate few-shot learning as a sequential meta-learning problem: each ""example"" includes a sequence of batches of ""training"" pairs, followed by a final ""test"" batch. The inputs at each ""step"" include the outputs of a ""base learner"" (e.g., training loss and gradients), as well as the base learner's current state (parameters). The paper applies an LSTM to this meta-learning problem, using the inner memory cells in the *second* layer to directly model the updated parameters of the base learner. In doing this, they note similarities between the respective update rules of LSTM memory cells and gradient descent. Updates to the LSTM meta-learner are computed based on the base learner's prediction loss for the final ""test"" batch. The authors make several simplifying assumptions, such as sharing weights across all second layer cells (analogous to using the same learning rate for all parameters). The paper recreates the Mini-ImageNet data set proposed in Vinyals et al 2016, and shows that the meta-learner LSTM is competitive with the current state-of-the-art (Matchin Networks, Vinyals 2016) on 1- and 5-shot learning.

Strengths:
- It is intriguing -- and in hindsight, natural -- to cast the few-shot learning problem as a sequential (meta-)learning problem. While the authors did not originate the general idea of persisting learning across a series of learning problems, I think it is fair to say that they have advanced the state of the art, though I cannot confidently assert its novelty as I am not deeply familiar with recent work on meta-learning.
- The proposed approach is competitive with and outperforms Vinyals 2016 in 1-shot and 5-shot Mini-ImageNet experiments.
- The base learner in this setting (simple ConvNet classifier) is quite different from the nearest-neighbor-on-top-of-learned-embedding approach used in Vinyals 2016. It is always exciting when state-of-the-art results can be reported using very different approaches, rather than incremental follow-up work.
- As far as I know, the insight about the relationship between the memory cell and gradient descent updates is novel here. It is interesting regardless.
- The paper offers several practical insights about how to design and train an LSTM meta-learner, which should make it easier for others to replicate this work and apply these ideas to new problems. These include proper initialization, weight sharing across coordinates, and the importance of normalizing/rescaling the loss, gradient, and parameter inputs. Some of the insights have been previously described (the importance of simulating test conditions during meta-training; assuming independence between meta-learner and base learner parameters when taking gradients with respect to the meta-learner parameters), but the discussion here is useful nonetheless.

Weaknesses:
- The writing is at times quite opaque. While it describes very interesting work, I would not call the paper an enjoyable read. It took me multiple passes (as well as consulting related work) to understand the general learning problem. The task description in Section 2 (Page 2) is very abstract and uses notation and language that is not common outside of this sub-area. The paper could benefit from a brief concrete example (based on MNIST is fine), perhaps paired with a diagram illustrating a sequence of few-shot learning tasks. This would definitely make it accessible to a wider audience.
- Following up on that note, the precise nature of the N-class, few-shot learning problem here is unclear to me. Specifically, the Mini-ImageNet data set has 100 labels, of which 64/16/20 are used during meta-training/validation/testing. Does this mean that only 64/100 classes are observed through meta-training? Or does it mean that only 64/100 are observed in each batch, but on average all 100 are observed during meta-training? If it's the former, how many outputs does the softmax layer of the ConvNet base learner have during meta-training? 64 (only those observed in training) or 100 (of which 36 are never observed)? Many other details like these are unclear (see question).
- The plots in Figure 2 are pretty uninformative in and of themselves, and the discussion section offers very little insight around them.

697,True,Optimization as a Model for Few-Shot Learning,"This work presents an LSTM based meta-learning framework to learn the optimization algorithm of a another learning algorithm (here a NN).
The paper is globally well written and the presentation of the main material is clear. The crux of the paper: drawing the parallel between Robbins Monroe update rule and the LSTM update rule and exploit it to satisfy the two main desiderata of few shot learning (1- quick acquisition of new knowledge, 2- slower extraction of general transferable knowledge) is intriguing. 

Several tricks re-used from (Andrychowicz et al. 2016)  such as parameter sharing and normalization, and novel design choices (specific implementation of batch normalization) are well  motivated. 
The experiments are convincing. This is a strong paper. My only concerns/questions are the following:

1. Can it be redundant to use the loss, gradient and parameters as input to the meta-learner? Did you do ablative studies to make sure simpler combinations are not enough.
2. It would be great if other architectural components of the network can be learned in a similar fashion (number of neurons, type of units, etc.). Do you have an opinion about this?
3. The related work section (mainly focused on meta learning) is a bit shallow. Meta-learning is a rather old topic and similar approaches have been tried to solve the same problem even if they were not using LSTMs:
     - Samy Bengio PhD thesis (1989) is all about this ;-)
     - Use of genetic programming for the search of a new learning rule for neural networks (S. Bengio, Y. Bengio, and J. Cloutier. 1994)

700,False,Neural Causal Regularization under the Independence of Mechanisms Assumption,"The present submission discusses a ""causal regularizer"", which promotes the use of causal dependencies (X -> Y, where X is a feature of the learning problem, and Y is the target variable) in predictive models. Similarly, such causal regularizer penalizes the use of non-causal dependencies, which can arise due to reverse causation (Y -> X) or confounding (X <- Z -> Y, where Z is a hidden confounder).

+ Overall, this submission tackles one of the most important problems in machine learning, which is to build causal models. The paper discusses and addresses this issue effectively when applied to a dataset in heart disease. In their experiments, the authors correctly identify some of the common causes of heart disease by virtue of their causal regularizer.

- The authors do not discuss the robustness of their approach with respect to choice of hyper-parameters (both describing the neural network architecture and the generative model that synthesizes artificial causal data). This seems like a crucial issue, in particular when dealing with medical data.

- The conclusions of the experimental evaluation should be discussed in greater length. On the one hand, Figure 4.a shows that there are no differences between L1 and causal regularization in terms of predictive performance, but it is difficult to conclude if this result is statistically significant without access to error-bars. On the other hand, Table 3 describes the qualitative differences between L1 and causal regularization. However, this table is hard to read: How were the 30 rows selected? What does the red highlighting mean? Are these red rows some true causal features that were missed? If so, this is related to precision. What about recall? Did the causal regularization pick up many non-causal features as causal?

- Regarding causal classifiers, this paper should do a much better job at reviewing previous work. For instance, the paper ""Towards a Learning Theory of Cause-Effect Inference"" from Lopez-Paz et al. is missing from the references. However, this prior work studies many of the aspects that are hinted as novel in this submission. In particular, the prior work of Lopez-Paz 1) introduces the concept of Mother distribution (referred as Nature hyper-prior in this submission) which explicitly factorizes the distribution over causes and mechanisms, 2) circumvented intractable likelihoods by synthesizing and training on causal data, 3) tackled the confounding case (compare Figure 1 of this submission and Appendix C of Lopez-Paz), and 4) dealt with discrete data seamlessly (such as the ChaLearn data from Section 5.3 in Lopez-Paz).

On a positive note, this is a well-written paper that addresses the important, under-appreciated problem of incorporating causal reasoning into machine learning. On a negative note, the novelty of the technical contributions is modest and the qualitative evaluation of the results could be greatly extended.

701,False,Neural Causal Regularization under the Independence of Mechanisms Assumption,"This paper proposes to use a causality score to weight a sparsity regularizer.  In that way, selected variables trade off between being causal and discriminative.  The framework is primarily evaluated on a proprietary health dataset.  While the dataset does give a good motivation to the problem setting, the paper falls a bit short for ICLR due to the lack of additional controlled experiments, relatively straightforward methodology (given the approach of Chalupka et al., arXiv Preprint, 2016, which is a more interesting paper from a technical perspective), and paucity of theoretical motivation.

At the core of this paper, the approach is effectively to weight a sparsity regularizer so that ""causal"" variables (as determined by a separate objective) are more likely to be selected.  This is generally a good idea, but we do not get a proper validation of this from the experiments as ground truth is absent.  A theorem on identifiability of causal+discriminative variables from a data sample combined with adequate synthetic experiments would have probably been sufficient, for example, to push the paper towards accept from a technical perspective, but as it is, it is lacking in insight and reproducibility.",,5.0,4.0
702,False,Neural Causal Regularization under the Independence of Mechanisms Assumption,"The authors extend their method of causal discovery (Chalupka et al 2016) to include assumptions about sparsity via regularization.  They apply this extension to an interesting private dataset from Sutter Health.  While an interesting direction, I found the presentation somewhat confused, the methodological novelty smaller than the bulk of ICLR works, and the central results (or perhaps data; see below) inadequate to address questions of causality.

First, I found the presentation somewhat unclear.  The paper at some points seems to be entirely focused on healthcare data, at other points it uses it as a motivating example, and at other points it is neglected.  Also, algorithm 1 seems unreferenced, and I'm not entirely sure why it is needed.  Figure 2 is not needed for this community.  The key methodological advance in this work appears in section 2.1 (Causal regularizer), but it is introduced amidst toy examples and without clear terminology or standard methodological assumptions/build-up.  In Section 3.1 (bottom of first paragraph), key data and results seem to be relegated to the appendices.  Thus overall the paper read rather haphazardly.  Finally, there seems to be an assumption throughout of fairly intimate familiarity with the Cholupka preprint, which i think should be avoided.  This paper should stand alone.

Second, while the technical contributions/novelty are not a focus of the paper's presentation, I am concerned by the lack of methodological advance.  Essentially a regularization objective is added to the previous method, which of itself is not a bad idea, but I can't point to a technical novelty in the paper that the community can not do without.

Third, fundamentally i don't see how the experiments address the central question of causality; they show regularization behaving as expected (or rather, influencing weights as expected), but I don't think we really have any meaningful quantitative evidence that causality has been learned.  This was briefly discussed (see ""ground truth causality?"" and the response below).  I appreciate the technical challenges/impossibility of having such a dataset, but if that's the case, then I think this work is premature, since there is no way to really validate.

Overall it's clearly a sincere effort, but I found it wanting in terms of a few critical areas.",,4.0,4.0
703,False,Neural Causal Regularization under the Independence of Mechanisms Assumption,"Learning classifiers to distinguish between causal, anticausal, and confounded dependencies is not a novel idea. It was introduced in the competitions of Guyon [1,2], and later developed in the context of kernel machines [3,4], learning theory [4], and neural networks [5]. These classifiers were applied to discrete data [1,2,3,4,5,6], extend to multiple random variables [4 Appendix C, 6], generalize the additive noise model assumption [5,6], consider hidden confounding [1,2,4 Appendix C, 6], and make use of classifier soft-scores to measure predictive uncertainty [1,2,3,4,5,6].

The idea of causal regularization is not novel, either. It was proposed at least in [1 Page 181] and [2 Section 3]. Causal regularization is also at the heart of invariant prediction [7], and causal transfer [8,9].

704,False,CONTENT2VEC: SPECIALIZING JOINT REPRESENTATIONS OF PRODUCT IMAGES AND TEXT FOR THE TASK OF PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION,"The problem of utilizing all available information (across modalities) about a product to learn a meaningful ""joint"" embedding is an interesting one, and certainly seems like it a promising direction for improving recommender systems, especially in the ""cold start"" scenario. I'm unaware of approaches combining as many modalities as proposed in this paper, so an effective solution could indeed be significant. However, there are many aspects of the proposed architecture that seem sub-optimal to me:

1. A major benefit of neural-network based systems is that the entire system can be trained end-to-end, jointly. The proposed approach sticks together largely pre-trained modules for different modalities... this can be justifiable when there is very little training data available on which to train jointly. With 10M product pairs, however, this doesn't seem to be the case for the Amazon dataset (although I haven't worked with this dataset myself so perhaps I'm missing something... either way it's not discussed at all in the paper). I consider the lack of a jointly fine-tuned model a major shortcoming of the proposed approach.

2. The discussion of ""pairwise residual units"" is confusing and not well-motivated. The residual formulation (if I understand it correctly) applies a ReLU layer to the concatenation of the modality specific embeddings, giving a new similarity (after dot products) that can be added to the similarity obtained from the concatenation directly. Why not just have an additional fully-connected layer that mixes the modality specific embeddings to form a final embedding (perhaps of lower dimensionality)? This should at least be presented as a baseline, if the pairwise residual unit is claimed as a contribution... I don't find the provided explanation convincing (in what way does the residual approach reduce parameter count?).

3. More minor: The choice of TextCNN for the text embedding vectors seems fine (although I wonder how an LSTM-based approach would perform)... However the details surrounding how it is used are obscured in the paper. In response to a question, the authors mention that it runs on the concatenation of the first 10 words of the title and product description. Especially for the description, this seems insufficiently long to contain a lot of information to me.

More care could be given to motivating the choices made in the paper. Finally, I'm not familiar with state of the art on this dataset... do the comparisons accurately reflect it? It seems only one competing technique is presented, with none on the more challenging cold-start scenarios.

705,False,CONTENT2VEC: SPECIALIZING JOINT REPRESENTATIONS OF PRODUCT IMAGES AND TEXT FOR THE TASK OF PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION,"This paper proposes combining different modalities of product content (e.g. review text, images, co-purchase info ...etc) in order to learn one unified product representation for recommender systems. While the idea of combining multiple sources of information is indeed an effective approach for handling data sparsity in recommender systems, I have some reservations on the approach proposed in this paper:

1) Some modalities are not necessarily relevant for the recommendation task or item similarity. For example, cover images of books or movies (which are product types in the experiments of this paper) do not tell us much about their content. The paper should clearly motivate and show how different modalities contribute to the final task.

2) The connection between the proposed joint product embedding and residual networks is a bit awkward. The original residual layers are composed of adding the original input vector to the output of an MLP, i.e. several affine transformations followed by non-linearities. These layers allow training very deep neural networks (up to 1000 layers) as a result of easier gradient flow. In contrast, the pairwise residual unit of this paper adds the dot product of two item vectors to the dot product of the same vectors but after applying a simple non-linearity. The motivation of this architecture is not very obvious, and is not well motivated in the paper.

3) While it is a minor point, but the choice of the term embedding for the dot product of two items is not usual. Embeddings usually refer to vectors in R^n, and for specific entities. Here it refers to the final output, and renders the output layer in Figure 2 pointless.

706,False,CONTENT2VEC: SPECIALIZING JOINT REPRESENTATIONS OF PRODUCT IMAGES AND TEXT FOR THE TASK OF PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION,"The paper proposes a method to combine arbitrary content into recommender systems, such as images, text, etc. These various features have been previously used to improve recommender systems, though what's novel here is the contribution of a general-purpose framework to combine arbitrary feature types.

Positively, the idea of combining many heterogeneous feature types into RS is ambitious and fairly novel. Previous works have certainly sought to include various feature types to improve RSs, though combining different features types successfully is difficult.

Negatively, there are a few aspects of the paper that are a bit ad-hoc. In particular:
-- There are a lot of pieces here being ""glued together"" to build the system. Different parts are trained separately and then combined together using another learning stage. There's nothing wrong with doing things in this way (and indeed it's the most straightforward and likely to work approach), but it pushes the contribution more toward the ""system building"" direction as opposed to the ""end-to-end learning"" direction which is more the focus of this conference.
-- Further to the above, this makes it hard to say how easily the model would generalize to arbitrary feature types, say e.g. if I had audio or video features describing the item. To incorporate such features into the system would require a lot of implementation work, as opposed to being a system where I can just throw more features in and expect it to work.

The pre-review comments address some of these issues. Some of the responses aren't entirely convincing, e.g. it'd be better to have the same baselines across tables, rather than dropping some because ""the case had already been made elsewhere"".

Other than that, I like the effort to combine several different feature types in real recommender systems datasets. I'm not entirely sure how strong the baselines are, they seem more like ablation-style experiments rather than comparison against any state-of-the-art RS.
",,5.0,3.0
707,False,CONTENT2VEC: SPECIALIZING JOINT REPRESENTATIONS OF PRODUCT IMAGES AND TEXT FOR THE TASK OF PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION,"Thanks for your questions. We shall try to adress them in the following:

Question 1: There are many modules in the system that are trained separately. Furthemore, fine-tuning for e.g. the image model appears to only take place on the FC7 layer. Jointly training all the components of the model would presumably improve performance, perhaps considerably. Did you try this? If not, why not?

No we did not. We were primarily interested in knowing the additional performance one can gain by merging pretrained models and re-specializing them to the task. We agree that for the paper it would have been a worthy experiment but we did not get to it due to time constraints. We will try to add it in the next paper update.

Question 2: For the joint product embedding, it was stated that a fully connected hidden layer that mixes the individual embeddings wasn't used in order to have a smaller number of parameters and increase comprehensibility. But presumably it could also perform better than the chosen approach. Did you try it?

We made some attempts but the convergence speed was bad. It is also on the to-do list for the next paper update.

Question 3: Could you provide some more details on the way TextCNN was used? Was it used on full product descriptions, even when they consist of multiple sentences? Were titles and descriptions embedded separately?

Sure! We decided to not embed the titles and descriptions separately, but concatenate the two and keep the first ten words without stop words (with empty word padding for shorter sequences). This method can definitely be extended to the full description since text CNN are quite robust to the length of the sequence.

Question 4:  In the table of results at the end, I didn't see any results for a model trained on both the books and movies data and tested on both in the cold start scenario. Did you evaluate this case?

Yes, we did try and as expected the results were not great, since the current version of the model does not support category-specific embeddings. Therefore, the resulting overall distance between products is a compromise between the two category-specific distances. If interested, we can provide you the results we achieved.

Question 5: Earlier work on content-based recommendation focused on not just performance but also on the interpretability of the resulting models. Can you say anything about whether effective interpretations of the models latent dimensions can be gleaned when learning in this way?

We only explored the text interpretability by looking at the top activating word embeddings  for each of the text convolutions. What we saw is that most of the 100 unigram filters used in the convolution layer corresponds to a topic (could be clusters corresponding to a genre, a date or an author). It looks like while learning the right text representation for book pairwise similarity prediction the model discovers naturally occuring book topics. The paper was already long so we decide not to publish them, but if you are interested, we can provide them.

Question 6: Is Prod2Vec realistic in cold-start scenarios? Presumably co-purchase information wouldn't be available for cold-start products and thus an embedding couldn't be estimated.

The reason why we keep Prod2vec only in Content2vec + is because prod2vec only works when you have available collaborative filtering signal on at least some of the products in test. That is why prod2vec and content2vec+ algorithm results are only reported in the two datasets with some CF signal.

Question 7: I didn't understand why different sets of baselines seem to appear across the three tables, but maybe I missed some detail here.

We used the hard cold start dataset to do the extensive analysis of our architecture VS other available methods. We dropped crossfeat because we made the case in the hard cold start dataset.

708,True,Diet Networks: Thin Parameters for Fat Genomics,"The paper presents an application of deep learning to genomic SNP data
with a comparison of possible approaches for dealing with the very
high data dimensionality. The approach looks very interesting but the
experiments are too limited to draw firm conclusions about the
strengths of different approaches. The presentation would benefit from
more precise math.


Quality:

The basic idea of the paper is interesting and the applied deep
learning methodology appears reasonable. The experimental evaluation
is rather weak as it only covers a single data set and a very limited
number of cross validation folds. Given the significant variation in
the performances of all the methods, it seems the differences between
the better-performing methods are probably not statistically
significant. More comprehensive empirical validation could clearly
strengthen the paper.


Clarity:

The writing is generally good both in terms of the biology and ML, but
more mathematical rigour would make it easier to understand precisely
what was done. The different architectures are explained on an
intuitive level and might benefit from a clear mathematical
definition. I was ultimately left unsure of what the ""raw end2end""

711,False,Beyond Fine Tuning: A Modular Approach to Learning on Small Data,"This paper presents a new technique for adapting a neural network to a new task for which there is not a lot of training data. The most widely used current technique is that of fine-tuning. The idea in this paper is to instead learn a network that learns features that are complementary to the fixed network. Additionally, the authors consider the setting where the new network/features are “stitched” to the old one at various levels in the hieararchy, rather that it just being a parallel “tower”. 

This work is similar in spirit (if not in some details) to the Progressive Nets paper by Rusu et al, as already discussed. The motivations and experiments are certainly different so this submission has merit on its own.

The idea of learning a “residual” with the stitched connnections is very similar in spirit to the ResNet work. It would be nice to compare and contrast those approaches.

I’ve never seen a batch being used 5 times in a row during training, does this work better than just regular SGD?

In Figure 5 it’d be nice to label the y-axis. That Figure would also benefit from not being a bar chart, but simply emulating Figure 4, which is much more readable!

Figure 5 again: what is an untrained model? It’s not immediately obvious why this is a good idea at all. Is TFT-1 simply fine-tuning one more layer than “Retrain Softmax”?

I think that the results at the end of section 3 are a bit weak because of usage of a big network. I would definitely like to see how the results change if using a smaller net.

The authors claim throughout the paper that the purpose of the added connections and layers is to learn *complementary* features and they show this with some figures. The latter are a convinving evidence, but not proof or guarantee that this is what is actually happening. I suggest the authors consider adding an explicit constraint in their loss that encourages that, e.g. by having a soft orthogonality constraing (assuming one can project intermediate features to some common feature dimensionality). The usage of very small L2 regularization maybe achieves the same thing, but there’s no evidence for that in the paper (in that we don’t have any visualizations of what happens if there’s no L2 reg.).

One of the big questions for me while reading the paper was how would an ensemble of 2 pre-trained nets would do on the tasks that the authors consider. This is especially relevant in the cars classification example, where I suspect that a strong baseline is that of fine-tuning VGG on this task, fine-tuning resnet on this task, and possibly training a linear combination of the two outputs or just averaging them naively.

Disappointing that there are no results in figure 4, 5 and 8 except the ones from this paper. It’s really hard to situate this paper if we don’t actually know how it compares to previously published results.


In general, this was an interesting and potentially useful piece of work. The problem of efficiently reusing the previously trained classifier for retraining on a small set is certainly interesting to the community.

712,False,Beyond Fine Tuning: A Modular Approach to Learning on Small Data,"This paper proposes a method of augmenting pre-trained networks for one task with an additional inference path specific to an additional task, as a replacement for the standard “fine-tuning” approach.

Pros:
-The method is simple and clearly explained.
-Standard fine-tuning is used widely, so improvements to and analysis of it should be of general interest.
-Experiments are performed in multiple domains -- vision and NLP.

Cons:
-The additional modules incur a rather large cost, resulting in 2x the parameters and roughly 3x the computation of the original network (for the “stiched” network).  These costs are not addressed in the paper text, and make the method significantly less practical for real-world use where performance is very often important.

-Given these large additional costs, the core of the idea is not sufficiently validated, to me.  In order to verify that the improved performance is actually coming from some unique aspects of the proposed technique, rather than simply the fact that a higher-capacity network is being used, some additional baselines are needed:
(1) Allowing the original network weights to be learned for the target task, as well as the additional module.  Outperforming this baseline on the validation set would verify that freezing the original weights provides an interesting form of regularization for the network.
(2) Training the full module/stitched network from scratch on the *source* task, then fine-tuning it for the target task.  Outperforming this baseline would verify that having a set of weights which never “sees” the source dataset is useful.

-The method is not evaluated on ImageNet, which is far and away the most common domain in which pre-trained networks are used and fine-tuned for other tasks.  I’ve never seen networks pre-trained on CIFAR deployed anywhere, and it’s hard to know whether the method will be practically useful for computer vision applications based on CIFAR results -- often improved performance on CIFAR does not translate to ImageNet.  (In other contexts, such as more theoretical contributions, having results only on small datasets is acceptable to me, but network fine-tuning is far enough on the “practical” end of the spectrum that claiming an improvement to it should necessitate an ImageNet evaluation.)

Overall I think the proposed idea is interesting and potentially promising, but in its current form is not sufficiently evaluated to convince me that the performance boosts don’t simply come from the use of a larger network, and the lack of ImageNet evaluation calls into question its real-world application.

===============

Edit (1/23/17): I had indeed missed the fact that the Stanford Cars does do transfer learning from ImageNet -- thanks for the correction.  However, the experiment in this case is only showing late fusion ensembling, which is a conventional approach compared with the ""stitched network"" idea which is the real novelty of the paper.  Furthermore the results in this case are particularly weak, showing only that an ensemble of ResNet+VGG outperforms VGG alone, which is completely expected given that ResNet alone is a stronger base network than VGG (""ResNet+VGG > ResNet"" would be a stronger result, but still not surprising). Demonstrating the stitched network idea on ImageNet, comparing with the corresponding VGG-only or ResNet-only finetuning, could be enough to push this paper over the bar for me, but the current version of the experiments here don't sufficiently validate the stitched network idea, in my opinion.",,4.0,4.0
713,False,Beyond Fine Tuning: A Modular Approach to Learning on Small Data,"This paper proposed to perform finetuning in an augmentation fashion by freezing the original network and adding a new model aside it. The idea itself is interesting and complements existing training and finetuning approaches, although I think there are a few baseline approaches that can be compared against, such as:

(1) Ensemble: in principle, the idea is similar to an ensembling approach where multiple networks are ensembled together to get a final prediction. The approach in Figure 1 should be compared with such ensemble baselines - taking multiple source domain predictors, possibly with the same modular setting as the proposed method, and compare the performance.

(2) comparison with late fusion: if we combine the pretrained network and a network finetuned from the pretrained one, and do a late fusion?

Basically, I think it is a valuable argument in section 3.2 (and Figure 4) that finetuning with a small amount of data may hurt the performance in general. This builds the ground for freezing a pretrained network and only augmenting it, not changing it. I agree with the authors on this argument, although currently other than Figure 4 there seem to be little empirical study that justifies it.

It is worth noting that Figure 3 seems to suggest that some of the module filters are either not converging or are learning unuseful features - like the first two filters in 3(a).

714,False,Diverse Beam Search: Decoding Diverse Solutions from Neural Sequence Models,"This paper considers the problem of decoding diverge solutions from neural sequence models. It basically adds an additional term to the log-likelihood of standard neural sequence models, and this additional term will encourage the solutions to be diverse. In addition to solve the inference, this paper uses a modified beam search.

On the plus side, there is not much work on producing diverse solutions in RNN/LSTM models. This paper represents one of the few works on this topic. And this paper is well-written and easy to follow.

The novel of this paper is relatively small. There has been a lot of prior work on producing diverse models in the area of probailistic graphical models. Most of them introduce an additional term in the objective function to encourage diversity. From that perspective, the solution proposed in this paper is not that different from previous work. Of course, one can argue that most previous work focues on probabilistic graphical models, while this paper focuses on RNN/LSTM models. But since RNN/LSTM can be simply interpreted as a probabilistic model, I would consider it a small novelty.

The diverse beam search seems to straightforward, i.e. it partitions the beam search space into groups, and does not consider the diversity within group (in order to reduce the search space). To me, this seems to be a simple trick. Note most previous work on diverse solutions in probabilistic graphical models usually involve developing some nontrivial algorithmic solutions, e.g. in order to achieve efficiency. In comparison, the proposed solution in this paper seems to be simplistic for a paper.

[ Summary ]

This paper presents a new modified beam search algorithm that promotes diverse beam candidates. It is a well known problem —with both RNNs and also non-neural language models— that beam search tends to generate beam candidates that are very similar with each other, which can cause two separate but related problems: (1) search error: beam search may not be able to discover a globally optimal solution as they can easily fall out of the beam early on, (2) simple, common, non-diverse output: the resulting output text tends to be generic and common.

This paper aims to address the second problem (2) by modifying the search objective function itself so that there is a distinct term that scores diversity among the beam candidates. In other words, the goal of the presented algorithm is not to reduce the search error of the original objective function. In contrast, stack decoding and future cost estimation, common practices in phrase-based SMT, aim to address the search error problem.

[ Merits ]

I think the Diverse Beam Search (DBS) algorithm proposed by the authors has some merits. It may be useful when we cannot rely on traditional beam search on the original objective function either because the trained model is not strong enough, or because of the search error, or because the objective itself does not align with the goal of the application.

[ Weaknesses ]

It is however not entirely clear how the proposed method compares against more traditional approaches like stack decoding and future cost estimation, on tasks like machine translation, as the authors compare their algorithm mainly against L&J’s diverse LM models and simple beam search.

In fact, modification to the objective function has been applied even in the neural MT context. For example, see equation (14) in page 12 of the following paper:

717,False,Low-rank passthrough neural networks,"The author proposes the use of low-rank matrix in feedfoward and RNNs. In particular, they try their approach in a GRU and a feedforward highway network.

Author also presents as a contribution the passthrough framework, which can describe feedforward and recurrent networks. However, this framework seems hardly novel, relatively to the formalism introduced by LSTM or highway networks.

An empirical evaluation is performed on different datasets (MNIST, memory/addition tasks, sequential permuted MNIST and character level penntreebank). 

However, there are few problems with the evaluation:

- In the highway network experiment, the author does not compare with a baseline.
We can not assess what it the impact of the low-rank parameterization. Also, it would be interesting to compare the result with a highway network that have this capacity bottleneck across layer  (first layer of size $n$, second layer of size $d$, third layer of size $n$) and not in the gate functions. Also, how did you select the hyperparameter values?.

- It is unfortunate that the character level penntreebank does not use the same experimental setting than previous works as it prevents from direct comparison.
Also the overall bpc perplexity seems relatively high for this dataset. It is therefore not clear how low-rank decomposition would perform on this task applied on a stronger baseline.

-Author claims state-of-art in the memory task. However, their approach uses  more parameters than the uRNN (41K against 6.5K for the memory) which makes the comparison a little bit unfair toward uRNN. It would be informative to see how low-rank RNN performs using overall 6.5K parameters. Generally, it would be good to see what is the impact of the matrix rank given a fix state size.

- It would be informative as well to have the baseline and the uRNN curve in Figure 2 for the memory/addition task.

That said, I found the results not very convincing overall. Results are overall not as good as state-of-the-art on sequential MNIST or the memory task, but add one more hyper-parameter to tune. As I said, it would help to show in Tables and/or Figures competing approaches like uRNNs.",,5.0,
719,False,Low-rank passthrough neural networks,"The authors study the use of low-rank approximation to the matrix-multiply in RNNs. This reduces the number of parameters by a large factor, and with a diagonal addition (called low-rank plus diagonal) it is shown to work as well as a fully-parametrized network on a number of tasks.

The paper is solid, the only weakness being some claims about conceptual unification (e.g., the first line of the conclusion -- ""We presented a framework that unifies the description various types of recurrent and feed-forward
neural networks as passthrough neural networks."" -- claiming this framework as a contribution of this paper is untrue, the general framework is well known in the community and RNNs have been presented in this way before.)

Aside from the above small point, the true contribution is in making low-rank RNNs work, the results are generally as good as fully-parametrized networks.

720,False,Understanding trained CNNs by indexing neuron selectivity,"This paper makes three main methodological contributions:
 - definition of Neural Feature (NF) as the pixel average of the top N images that highly activation a neuron
 - ranking of neurons based on color selectivity
 - ranking of neurons based on class selectivity

The main weaknesses of the paper are that none of the methodological contributions are very significant, and no singularly significant result arises from the application of the methods.

However, the main strengths of the paper are its assortment of moderately-sized interesting conclusions about the basic behavior of neural nets. For example, a few are:
 - “Indexing on class selectivity neurons we found highly class selective neurons like digital-clock at conv2, cardoon at conv3 and ladybug at conv5, much before the fully connected layers.” As far as I know, this had not been previously reported.
 - Color selective neurons are found even in higher layers. (25% color selectivity in conv5)
 - “our main color axis emerge (black-white, blue-yellow, orange-cyan and cyan- magenta). Curiously, these two observations correlate with evidences in the human visual system (Shapley & Hawken (2011)).” Great observation!

Overall, I’d recommend the paper be accepted, because although it’s difficult to predict at this time, there’s a fair chance that one of the “smaller conclusions” would turn out to be important in hindsight a few years hence.


Other small comments:
 - The cite for “Learning to generate chairs…” is wrong (first two authors combined resulting in a confusing cite)

 - What exactly is the Color Selectivity Index computing? The Opponent Color Space isn’t well defined and it wasn’t previously familiar to me. Intuitively it seems to be selecting for units that respond to a constant color, but the highest color selectivity NF in Fig 5 i for a unit with two colors, not one. Finally, the very last unit (lowest color selectivity) is almost the same edge pattern, but with white -> black instead of blue -> orange. Why are these considered to be so drastically different? This should probably be more clearly described.

 - For the sake of argument, imagine a mushroom sensitive neuron in conv5 that fires highly for mushrooms of *any* color but not for anything else. If the dataset contains only red-capped mushrooms, would the color selectivity index for this neuron be high or low? If it is high, it’s somewhat misleading because the unit itself actually isn’t color selective; the dataset just happens only to have red mushrooms in it. (It’s a subtle point but worth considering and probably discussing in the paper)",,7.0,4.0
721,False,Understanding trained CNNs by indexing neuron selectivity,"The authors analyze trained neural networks by quantifying the selectivity of individual neurons in the network for a variety of specific features, including color and category.   

Pros:
   * The paper is clearly written and has good figures. 
   * I think they executed their specific stated goal reasonably well technically.   E.g. the various indexes they use seem well-chosen for their purposes. 

Cons:
   * I must admit that I am biased against the whole enterprise of this paper.   I do not think it is well-motivated or provides any useful insight whatever.   What I view their having done is produced, and then summarized anecdotally, a catalog of piecemeal facts about a neural network without any larger reason to think these particular facts are important.  In a way, I feel like this paper suffers from the same problem that plagues a typical line of research in neurophysiology, in which a catalog of selectivity distributions of various neurons for various properties is produced -- full stop.  As if that were in and of itself important or useful information.   I do not feel that either the original neural version of that project, or this current model-based virtual electrophysiology, is that useful.   Why should we care about the distribution of color selectivities?   Why does knowing distribution as such constitute ""understanding""?    To my mind it doesn't, at least not directly.   

Here's what they could have done to make a more useful investigation:
  
     (a) From a neuroscience point of view, they could have compared the properties that they measure in models to the same properties as measured in neurons the real brain.   If they could show that some models are better matches on these properties to the actual neural data than others, that would be a really interesting result.   That is is to say, the two isolated catalogs of selectivities (from model neurons and real neurons)  alone seem pretty pointless.  But if the correspondence between the two catalogs was made -- both in terms of where the model neurons and the real neurons were similar, and (especially importantly) where they were different --- that would be the beginning of nontrivial understanding.   Such results would also complement a growing body of literature that attempts to link CNNs to visual brain areas.  Finding good neural data is challenging, but whatever the result, the comparison would be interesting. 

and/or 

    (b) From an artificial intelligence point of view, they could have shown that their metrics are *prescriptive* constraints.   That is, suppose they had shown that the specific color and class selectivity indices that they compute, when imposed as a loss-function criterion on an untrained neural network, cause the network to develop useful filters and achieve significantly above-chance performance on the original task the networks were trained on.     This would be a really great result, because it would not only give us a priori reason to care about the specific property metrics they chose, but it would also help contribute to efforts to find unsupervised (or semi-supervised) learning procedures, since the metrics they compute can be estimated from comparatively small numbers of stimuli and/or high-level semantic labels.    To put this in perspective, imagine that they had actually tested the above hypothesis and found it to be false:  that is, that their metrics, when used as loss function constraints, do not improve performance noticeably above chance performance.  What would we then make of this whole investigation?  It would then be reasonable to think that the measured properties were essentially epiphenomenal and didn't contribute at all to the power of neural networks in solving perceptual tasks.  (The same could be said about neurophysiology experiments doing the same thing.)  
     [--> NB: I've actually tried things just like this myself over the years, and have found exactly this disappointing result.  Specifically,  I've found a number of high-level generic statistical property of DNNs that seem like they might potentially ""interesting"", e.g. because they apparently correlate with complexity or appear to illustrate difference between low, intermediate and high layers of DNNs.  Every single one of these, when imposed as optimization constraints, has basically lead nowhere on the challenging tasks (like ImageNet) that cause the DNNs to be interesting in the first place.  Basically, there is to my mind no evidence at this point that highly-summarized generic statistical distributions of selectivities, like those illustrated here, place any interesting constraints on filter weights at all.   Of course, I haven't tried the specific properties the authors highlight in these papers, so maybe there's something important there.]

I know that both of these asks are pretty hard, but I just don't know what else to say -- this work otherwise seems like a step backwards for what the community ought to be spending its time on.

722,False,Understanding trained CNNs by indexing neuron selectivity,"This paper attempts to understand and visualize what deep nets are representing as one ascends from low levels to high levels of the network.  As has been shown previously, lower levels are more local image feature based, whereas higher levels correspond to abstract properties such as object identity.  In semantic space, we find higher level nodes to be more semantically selective, whereas low level nodes are more diffuse.

This seems like a good attempt to tease apart deep net representations.  Perhaps the most important finding is that color figures prominently into all levels of the network, and that performance on gray scale images is significantly diminished.  The new NF measure proposed here is sensible, but still based on the images shown to the network.  What one really wants to know is what function these nodes are computing - i.e., out of the space of *all* possible images, which most activate a unit?  Of course this is a difficult problem, but it would be nice to see us getting closer to understanding the answer.  The color analysis here I think brings us a bit closer.

It seems that the same idea could be used not just for pruning existing models, but also when building new architectures: selecting layers and their parameters as to achieve an optimal throughput rate. This could make for a nice direction for future work.

One point that is missing is some discussion of how transferable the performance model is to GPUs. This would make the technique easier to adopt broadly.

Pros
- This paper tackles a very crucial problem of understanding communications between 2 agents. As more and more applications of reinforcement learning are being explored, this approach brings us back to a basic question. Is the problem solving approach of machines similar to that of humans.

- The task is simple enough to make the post learning analysis intuitive.

- It was interesting to see how informed agents made use of multiple symbols to transmit the message, where as agnostic agents relied only on 2 symbols. 

Cons
- The task effectively boils down to image classification, if the 2 images sent are from different categories. The symbols used are effectively the image class which the second agent learns to assign to either of the images. By all means, this approach boils down to a transfer learning problem which could probably be trained much faster than a reinforcement learning algorithm.",,7.0,3.0
728,True,Multi-Agent Cooperation and the Emergence of (Natural) Language,"To train natural language systems by putting multiple agents within an interactive referential communication game is very nice.

Moreover, the approach of switching between these games and some supervised learning, as in the experiment described in Section 5 and suggested in Section 6, seems particularly fruitful. 

Note: For “clarity”, I believe some of the network connections in Fig 1 have been omitted. However, given the rather highly-customized architecture and the slightly hard-to-follow description in Section 3, the shorthand diagram only adds to the confusion. The diagram probably needs to be fine-tuned, but at the very least (especially if I am misunderstanding it!), a caption must [still] be added to help the reader interpret the figure.

729,True,Multi-Agent Cooperation and the Emergence of (Natural) Language,"In this paper, a referential game is proposed between two agents. Both agents observe two images. The first agent, called the sender, receive a binary target variable (t) and must send a symbol (message) to the second agent, called the receiver, such that this agent can recover the target. The agents both get a reward, if the receiver agent can predict the target. The paper proposes to parametrize the agents as neural networks - with pretrained representations of the images as feature vectors - and train them using REINFORCE. In this setting, it is shown that the agents converge to  optimal policies and that their learned communications (e.g. the symbolic code transmitted from the sender to the receiver) have some meaningful concepts. In addition to this, the paper presents experiments on a variant of the game grounded on different image classes. In this setting, the agents appear to learn even more meaningful concepts. Finally, multi-game setup is proposed, where the sender agent is alternating between playing the game before and playing a supervised learning task (classifying images). Not surprisingly, when anchored to the supervised learning task, the symbolic communications have even more meaningful concepts.

Learning shared representations for communication in a multi-agent setup is an interesting research direction to explore. This is a much harder task compared to standard supervised learning or single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, which justifies starting with a relatively simple task. To the best of my knowledge, the approach of first learning communication between two agents and then grounding this communication in human language is novel. As the authors remark, this may be an alternative paradigm to standard sequence-to-sequence models which tend to focus on statistical properties of language rather than their functional aspects. I believe the contributions of the proposed task and framework, and the analysis and visualization of what the communicated tokens represent is a useful stepping stone for future work. For this reason, I think the paper should be accepted.

730,False,"ParMAC: distributed optimisation of nested functions, with application to binary autoencoders","This paper proposes a novel approach ParMAC, a parallel and distributed framework of MAC (the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates) to learn nested and non-convex models which is based on the composition of multiple processing layers (i.e., deep nets). The basic idea of MAC to optimise the nested objective function, which is traditionally learned using methods based on the chain-rule gradients but inconvenient and is hard to parallelise, is to break nested functional relationships judiciously by introducing new variables ( the auxiliary coordinates) as equality constraints, and then to optimise a penalised function using alternating optimisation over the original parameters (W step) and over the coordinates (Z step).  The minimisation (W step) updates the parameters by splitting the nested model into independent submodels and training them using existing algorithms, and the coordination (Z step) ensures that corresponding inputs and outputs of submodels eventually match.  In this paper, the basic assumptions of ParMAC are that with large datasets in distributed systems, it is imperative to minimise data movement over the network because of the communication time generally far exceeds the computation time in modern architectures. Thus, the authors propose the ParMAC to translate the parallelism inherent in MAC into a distributed system by data parallelism and model parallelism. They also analyse its parallel speedup and convergence, and demonstrated it with MPI-based implementation to optimise binary autoencoders. The proposed ParMAC is tested on 3 colour image retrieval datasets. 

The organization of the paper is well written, and the presentation is clear. My questions are included in the following:
- The MAC framework solves the original problem approximately. If people use the sigmoid function to smooth the stepwise function, the naive optimization methods can be easier applied. What is the difference between these two? Or why do we want to use a new approach to solve it?
- The authors do not compare their ParMAC model with other distributed approaches for the same nested function optimization problem.",,6.0,4.0
731,False,"ParMAC: distributed optimisation of nested functions, with application to binary autoencoders","The paper presents an architecture to parallelize the optimization of nested functions based on the method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC) (Carreira-Perpinan and Wang, 2012). This method decomposes the optimization into training individual layers and updating the auxiliary coordinates. The paper focuses on binary autoencoders and proposes to partition the data onto several machines allowing the parameters to move between machines. Relatively good speedup factors are reported especially on larger datasets and a theoretical model of performance is presented that matches with the experiments.

My main concern is that even though the method is presented as a general framework for nested functions, experiments focus on a restricted family of models (i.e. binary autoencoders with linear or kernel encoders and linear decoders) with only two components. While the speedup factors are encouraging, it is hard to get a sense of their importance as the binary autoencoder model considered is not well studied by other researchers and is not widely used. I encourage the authors to apply this framework to more generic architectures and problems.

Questions:
1- Does this framework apply to some form of generic multi-layer neural network? If so, some experimental results are useful.
2- What is the implication of applying this framework to more than two components (an encoder and a decoder) and non-linear components?
3- It is desired to see a plot of performance as a function of time for different setups to demonstrate the speedup after convergence. It seems the paper only focuses on the speedup factors per iteration. For example, increasing the mini-batch size may improve the speed per iteration but may hurt the convergence speed.
4- Did you consider a scenario where the dataset is too big that storing the data and auxiliary variables on multiple machines simultaneously is not possible?

I looked at the arxiv version of the paper. It is much longer and appears more rigorous. Fig 3 there is indeed more insightful.
However, I am reviewing the submission and my overall assessment does not change. This is not a minor incremental contribution, and if you want to compress it into a conference submission of this type, I would recommend choosing message you want to convey, and focus on that. As you say, ""...ICLR submission focus on the ParMAC algorithm..."", I would focus on this properly - and remove or move to appendix all extensions and theoretical remarks, and have an extra page on explaining the algorithm. Additionally, make sure to clearly explain the relation of the arxiv paper, in particular that the submission was a compressed version.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
The submission proposes ParMAC, based on MAC (Method of Auxiliary Coordinates), formulating a distributed variant of the idea.

Related Work: In the part on convex ERM and methods, I would recommend citing general communication efficient frameworks, COCOA (Ma et al.) and AIDE (Reddi et al.). I believe these works are most related to the practical objectives authors of this paper set, while number of the papers cited are less relevant.

Section 2, explaining MAC, is quite clearly written, but I do not find part on MAC and EM particularly useful.

Section 3 is much less clearly written. I have trouble following notation, particularly in the speedups part, as different symbols were introduced at different places. Perhaps a quick summary or paragraph on notation in the introduction would be helpful. In paragraph 2, you write as if reader knew how data/anything is distributed, but this was not mentioned yet; it is specified later. It is not clear what is meant by ""submodel"". Perhaps a more precise example pointing back to eqs (1) & (2) would be useful. As far as I understand from what is written, there are P independent sets of submodels, that traverse the machines in circular fashion. I don't understand how are they initialized (identically?), and more importantly I don't understand what would be a single output of the algorithm (averaging? does not seem to make sense). Since this is not addressed, I suppose I get it wrong, leaving me to guess what was actually meant. 
The fact that I am not able to understand what is actually happening, I see as major issue.

I don't like the later paragraphs on extensions, model for speedup, convergence and topologies. I don't understand whether these are novel contributions or not, as the authors refer to other work for details. If these are novel, the explanation is not sufficient, particularly speedup part, which contains undefined quantities, e.g. T(P) (or I can't find it). If this is not novel, It does not provide enough explanation to understand anything more, compared with a its version compressed to 1/4 of its size and referring to the other work. The statement that we can recover the original convergence guarantees seems strong and I don't see why it should be trivial to show (but author point to other work which I did not look at). In topologies part, claiming that something does ""true SGD"", without explaining what is ""true SGD"" seems very strange. Other statements in this section seem also very vague and unjustified/unexplained.

Experimental section seems to suggest that the method is interesting for binary autoencoders, but I don't see how would I conclude anything about any other models. ParMAC is also not compared to alternative methods, only with itself, focusing on scaling properties.

Conclusion contains statements that are too strong or misleading based on what I saw. In particular, ""we analysed its parallel speedup and convergence"" seems ungrounded. Further, the claim ""The convergence properties of MAC remain essentially unaltered in ParMAC"" is unsupported, regardless of the meaning of ""essentially unchanged"".

733,False,"ParMAC: distributed optimisation of nested functions, with application to binary autoencoders","This paper proposes an extension of the MAC method in which subproblems are trained on a distributed cluster arranged in a circular configuration. The basic idea of MAC is to decouple the optimization between parameters and the outputs of sub-pieces of the model (auxiliary coordinates); optimization alternates between updating the coordinates given the parameters and optimizing the parameters given the outputs. In the circular configuration. Because each update is independent, they can be massively parallelized.

This paper would greatly benefit from more concrete examples of the sub-problems and how they decompose. For instance, can this be applied effectively for deep convolutional networks, recurrent models, etc? From a practical perspective, there's not much impact for this paper beyond showing that this particular decoupling scheme works better than others. 

There also seem to be a few ideas worth comparing, at least:
- Circular vs. parameter server configurations
- Decoupled sub-problems vs. parallel SGD

Parallel SGD also has the benefit that it's extremely easy to implement on top of NN toolboxes, so this has to work a lot better to be practically useful. 

Also, it's a bit hard to understand what exactly is being passed around from round to round, and what the trade-offs would be in a deep feed-forward network. Assuming you have one sub-problem for every hidden unit, then it seems like:

1. In the W step, different bits of the NN walk their way around the cluster, taking SGD steps w.r.t. the coordinates stored on each machine. This means passing around the parameter vector for each hidden unit.
2. Then there's a synchronization step to gather the parameters from each submodel, requiring a traversal of the circular structure.
3. Then each machine updates it's coordinates based on the complete model for a slice of the data. This would mean, for a feed-forward network, producing the intermediate activations of each layer for each data point.

So for something comparable to parallel SGD, you could do the following: put a mini-batch of size B on each machine with ParMAC, compared to running such mini-batches in parallel. Completing steps 1-2-3 above would then be roughly equivalent to one synchronized PS type implementation step (distribute model to workers, get P gradients back, update model.)

 It would be really helpful to see how this compares in practice. It's hard for me to understand intuitively why the proposed method is theoretically any better than parallel SGD (except for the issue of non-smooth function optimization); the decoupling also can fundamentally change the problem since you're not doing back-propagation directly anymore, so that seems like it would conflate things as well and it's not necessarily going to just work for other types of architectures.",,6.0,4.0

Cons:
- The performance gain over a baseline sequential model is marginal.
- The experiments are limited in scope, both in the datasets considered and in the evaluation metrics used to compare the model with other approaches. Specifically: (a) there is only one set of results on a real-world dataset and in that case the proposed model performs worse than the baseline, and (b) there is no evaluation of the learned latent representation with respect to other tasks such as classification.
- The ability of the model to generate trees in time proportional to the depth of the tree is proposed as a benefit of the approach, though this is not empirically validated in the experiments.

The procedures to generate and encode trees are clever in their repeated use of common operations. The weight sharing and gating operations seem important for this model to perform well but it is difficult to assess their utility without an ablation (in Table 1 and 2 these modifications are not evaluated side-by-side). Experiments in another domain (such as modeling source code, or parse trees conditioned on a sentence) would help in demonstrating the utility of this model.

737,True,Machine Comprehension Using Match-LSTM and Answer Pointer,"SUMMARY.
This paper proposes a new neural network architectures for solving the task of reading comprehension question answering where the goal is answering a questions regarding a given text passage.
The proposed model combines two well-know neural network architectures match-lstm and pointer nets.
First the passage and the questions are encoded with a unidirectional LSTM.
Then the encoded words in the passage and the encoded words in the questions are combined with an attention mechanism so that each word of the passage has a certain degree of compatibility with the question.
For each word in the passage the word representation and the weighted representation of the query is concatenated and passed to an forward lstm.
The same process is done in the opposite direction with a backward lstm.
The final representation is a concatenation of the two lstms.
As a decoded a pointer network is used.
The authors tried with two approaches: generating the answer word by word, and generating the first index and the last index of the answer.

The proposed model is tested on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset.
An ensemble of the proposed model achieves performance close to state-of-the-art models.


----------

OVERALL JUDGMENT

I think the model is interesting mainly because of the use of pointer networks as a decoder.
One thing that the authors could have tried is a multi-hop approach. It has been shown in many works to be extremely beneficial in the joint encoding of passage and query. The authors can think of it as a deep match-lstm.
The analysis of the model is interesting and insightful.
The sharing of the code is good.",,6.0,3.0
738,True,Machine Comprehension Using Match-LSTM and Answer Pointer,"The paper looks at the problem of locating the answer to a question in a text (For this task the answer is always part of the input text). For this the paper proposes to combine two existing works: Match-LSTM to relate question and text representations and Pointer Net to predict the location of the answer in the text.

Strength:
-	The suggested approach makes sense for the task and achieves good performance, (although as the authors mention, recent concurrent works achieve better results)
-	The paper is evaluated on the SQuAD dataset and achieves significant improvements over prior work.


Weaknesses:
1.	It is unclear from the paper how well it is applicable to other problem scenarios where the answer is not a subset of the input text.
2.	Experimental evaluation
2.1.	It is not clear why the Bi-Ans-Ptr in Table 2 is not used for the ensemble although it achieves the best performance.
2.2.	It would be interested if this approach generalizes to other datasets.


Other (minor/discussion points)
-	The task and approach seem to have some similarity of locating queries in images and visual question answering. The authors might want to consider pointing to related works in this direction.
-	I am wondering how much this task can be seen as a “guided extractive summarization”, i.e. where the question guides the summarization process.
-	Page 6, last paragraph: missing “.”: “… searching This…”



Summary:
While the paper presents an interesting combination of two approaches for the task of answer extraction, the novelty is moderate. While the experimental results are encouraging, it remains unclear how well this approach generalizes to other scenarios as it seems a rather artificial task.

739,True,Machine Comprehension Using Match-LSTM and Answer Pointer,"Summary:
The paper presents a deep neural network for the task of machine comprehension on the SQuAD dataset. The proposed model is based on two previous works -- match-LSTM and Pointer Net. Match-LSTM produces attention over each word in the given question for each word in the given passage, and sequentially aggregates this matching of each word in the passage with the words in the question. The pointer net is used to generate the answer by either generating each word in the answer or by predicting the starting and ending tokens in the answer from the provided passage. The experimental results show that both the variants of the proposed model outperform the baseline presented in the SQuAD paper. The paper also shows some analysis of the results obtained such as variation of performance across answer lengths and question types.

Strengths:
1. A novel end-to-end model for the task of machine comprehension rather than using hand-crafted features.
2. Significant performance boost over the baseline presented in the SQuAD paper.
3. Some insightful analyses of the results such as performance is better when answers are short, ""why"" questions are difficult to answer.

Weaknesses/Questions/Suggestions:
1. The paper does not show quantitatively how much modelling attention in match-LSTM and answer pointer layer helps. So, it would be insightful if authors could compare the model performance with and without attention in match-LSTM, and with and without attention in answer pointer layer.
2. It would be good if the paper could provide some insights into why there is a huge performance gap between boundary model and sequence model in the answer pointer layer.
3. I would like to see the variation in the performance of the proposed model for questions that require different types of reasoning (table 3 in SQuAD paper). This would provide insights into what are the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed model w.r.t the type reasoning required.
4. Could authors please explain why the activations resulting from {h^p}_i and {h^r}_{i-1} in G_i in equation 2 are being repeated across dimension of Q. Why not learn different activations for each dimension? 
5. I wonder why Bi-Ans-Ptr is not used in the ensemble model (last row in table 2) when it is shown that Bi-Ans-Ptr improves performance by 1.2% in F1.
6. Could authors please discuss and compare the DCR model (in table 2) in the paper in more detail?

Review Summary: The paper presents a reasonable end-to-end model for the task of machine comprehension on the SQuAD dataset, which outperforms the baseline model significantly. However, it would be good if more analyses / ablation studies / insights are included regarding -- how much attention helps, why is boundary model better than sequence model, how does the performance change when the reasoning required becomes difficult.",,7.0,3.0
740,True,Dialogue Learning With Human-in-the-Loop,"SUMMARY: This paper describes a set of experiments evaluating techniques for
training a dialogue agent via reinforcement learning. A
standard memory network architecture is trained on both bAbI and a version of
the WikiMovies dataset (as in Weston 2016, which this work extends). Numerous
experiments are performed comparing the behavior of different training
algorithms under various experimental conditions.

STRENGTHS: The experimentation is comprehensive. I agree with the authors that
these results provide additional useful insight into the performance of the
model in the 2016 paper (henceforth W16).

WEAKNESSES: This is essentially an appendix to the earlier paper. There is no
new machine learning content. Secondarily, the paper seems to confuse the
distinction between ""training with an adaptive sampling procedure"" and ""training
in interactive environments"" more generally. In particular, no comparisons are
presented to the to the experiments with a static exploration policy presented
in W16, when the two training can & should be evaluated side-by-side.
The only meaningful changes between this work and W16 involve simple
(and already well-studied) changes to the form of this exploration policy.

My primary concern remains about novelty: the extra data introduced here is
welcome enough, but probably belongs in a *ACL short paper or a technical
report. This work does not stand on its own, and an ICLR submission is not an
appropriate vehicle for presenting it.

""REINFORCEMENT LEARNING""

[Update: concerns in this section have been addressed by the authors.]

This paper attempts to make a hard distinction between the reinforcement
learning condition considered here and the (""non-RL"") condition considered in
W16. I don't think this distinction is nearly as sharp as it's
made out to be. 

As already noted in Weston 2016, the RBI objective is a special case of vanilla
policy gradient with a zero baseline and off-policy samples. In this sense the
version of RBI considered in this paper is the same as in W16, but with a
different exploration policy; REINFORCE is the same objective with a nontrivial
baseline. Similarly, the change in FP is only a change to the sampling policy.
The fixed dataset / online learning distinction is not especially meaningful
when the fixed dataset consists of endless synthetic data.

It should be noted that some variants of the exploration policy in W16 provide a
stronger training signal than is available in the RL ""from scratch"" setting
here: in particular, when $\pi_acc = 0.5$ the training samples will feature much
denser reward. However, if I correctly understand Figures 3 and 4 in this paper,
the completely random initial policy achieves an average reward of ~0.3 on bAbI
and ~0.1 on movies---as good or better than the other exploration policies in
W16!

I think this paper would be a lot clearer if the delta from W16 were expressed
directly in terms of their different exploration policies, rather than trying to
cast all of the previous work as ""not RL"" when it can be straightforwardly
accommodated in the RL framework.

I was quite confused by the fact that no direct comparisons are made to the
training conditions in the earlier work. I think this is a symptom of the
problem discussed above: once this paper adopts the position that this work is
about RL and the previous work is not, it becomes possible to declare that the
two training scenarios are incomparable. I really think this is a mistake---to
the extent that the off-policy sample generators used in the previous paper are
worse than chance, it is always possible to compare to them fairly here.
Evaluating everything in the ""online"" setting and presenting side-by-side
experiments would provide a much more informative picture of the comparative
behavior of the various training objectives.

ON-POLICY VS OFF-POLICY

Vanilla policy gradient methods like the ones here typically can't use
off-policy samples without a little extra hand-holding (importance sampling,
trust region methods, etc.). They seem to work out of the box for a few of the
experiments in this paper, which is an interesting result on its own. It would
be nice to have some discussion of why that might be the case.

OTHER NOTES

- The claim that ""batch size is related to off-policy learning"" is a little
odd. There are lots of on-policy algorithms that require the agent to collect a
large batch of transitions from the current policy before performing an 
(on-policy) update.

- I think the experiments on fine-tuning to human workers are the most exciting
part of this work, and I would have preferred to see these discussed (and
explored with) in much more detail rather than being relegated to the
penultimate paragraphs.",,5.0,4.0
741,True,Dialogue Learning With Human-in-the-Loop,"This paper builds on the work of Weston (2016), using End-to-end memory network models for a limited form of dialogue with teacher feedback. As the authors state in the comments, it is closely related to the question answering problem with the exception that a teacher provides a response after the model’s answer, which does not always come with a positive reward. Thus, the model must learn to use the teacher’s feedback to significantly improve performance.

Overall, the paper is written clearly, and several interesting models are tested. It is certainly only a limited form of dialogue that is considered (closer to question answering, since the questions do not require the agent to look further back into the context), but investigating in this direction could prove fruitful once the tasks are scaled up to be more difficult.

My main concern is with the paper`s novelty. In the words of the authors, this paper has two primary differences with the work of Weston:

“(i) That earlier work did not use the natural reinforcement learning/online setting, but “cheated” with a fixed policy given in advance. It is important to address the realistic online setting and assess whether the methods, particularly FP, still work, or else what changes (e.g. exploration, balancing, see Fig 4 and Table 1) are needed. (ii) That earlier work had only simulated data, and no real-language data, so was only toy. This work uses Mechanical Turk to do real experiments, which again is important to assess if these methods, particularly FP, work on real language.”

Point (ii) is very much appreciated, but adding additional human testing data is not sufficient for a conference paper. Thus, the main point of the paper is that “the model also works if we collect the data online (i.e. the agent’s policy is used to collect data rather than a fixed policy beforehand)”. While this is a step in the right direction, I’m not sure if it’s significant enough for an ICLR paper. Little model novelty is required to solve this additional requirement on these tasks beyond using epsilon greedy exploration. Thus, the paper is borderline accept/reject. 

EDIT: I have updated my score slightly in light of the author's response, where they make a good point that real-world implementation should be more strongly considered as part of the contribution.

742,False,Human perception in computer vision,"The paper reports several connections between the image representations in state-of-the are object recognition networks and findings from human visual psychophysics:
1) It shows that the mean L1 distance in the feature space of certain CNN layers is predictive of human noise-detection thresholds in natural images.
2) It reports that for 3 different 2-AFC tasks for which there exists a condition that is hard and one that is easy for humans, the mutual information between decision label and quantised CNN activations is usually higher in the condition that is easier for humans.
3) It reproduces the general bandpass nature of contrast/frequency detection sensitivity in humans. 

While these findings appear interesting, they are also rather anecdotal and some of them seem to be rather trivial (e.g. findings in 2). To make a convincing statement it would be important to explore what aspects of the CNN lead to the reported findings. One possible way of doing that could be to include good baseline models to compare against. As I mentioned before, one such baseline should be reasonable low-level vision model. Another interesting direction would be to compare the results for the same network at different training stages.

In that way one might be able to find out which parts of the reported results can be reproduced by simple low-level image processing systems,  which parts are due to the general deep network’s architecture and which parts arise from the powerful computational properties (object recognition performance) of the CNNs.

In conclusion, I believe that establishing correspondences between state-of-the art CNNs and human vision is a potentially fruitful approach. However to make a convincing point that found correspondences are non-trivial, it is crucial to show that non-trivial aspects of the CNN lead to the reported findings, which was not done. Therefore, the contribution of the paper is limited since I cannot judge whether the findings really tell me something about a unique relation between high-performing CNNs and the human visual system.

UPDATE:

Thank you very much for your extensive revision and inclusion of several of the suggested baselines. 
The results of the baseline models often raise more questions and make the interpretation of the results more complex, but I feel that this reflects the complexity of the topic and makes the work rather more worthwhile. 

One further suggestion: As the experiments with the snapshots of the CaffeNet shows, the direct relationship between CNN performance and prediction accuracy of biological vision known from Yamins et al. 2014 and Cadieu et al. 2014 does not necessarily hold in your experiments. I think this should be discussed somewhere in the paper.

All in all, I think that the paper now constitutes a decent contribution relating state-of-the art CNNs to human psychophysics and I would be happy for this work to be accepted.

744,False,Human perception in computer vision,"The author works to compare DNNs to human visual perception, both quantitatively and qualitatively. 

Their first result involves performing a psychophysical experiment both on humans and on a model and then comparing the results (actually I think the psychophysical data was collected in a different work, and is just used here).   The specific psychophysical experiment determined, separately for each of a set of approx. 1110 images, what the noise level of additive noise would have to be to make a just-noticeable-difference for humans in discriminating the noiseless image from the noisy one.   The authors then define a metric on neural networks that allows them to measure what they posit might be a similar property for the networks.  They then correlate the pattern of noise levels between neural networks that the humans.    Deep neural networks end up being much better predictors of the human pattern of noise levels than simpler measure of image perturbation (e.g. RMS contrast).  

A second result involves comparing DNNs to humans in terms of their pattern errors in a series of highly controlled experiments using stimuli that illustrate classic properties of human visual processing -- including segmentation, crowding and shape understanding.  They then used an information-theoretic single-neuron metric of discriminability to assess similar patterns of errors for the DNNs.   Again, top layers of DNNs were able to reproduce the human patterns of difficulty across stimuli, at least to some extent. 

A third result involves comparing DNNs to humans in terms of their pattern of contrast sensitivity across a series of sine-grating images at different frequencies.  (There is a classic result from vision research as to what this pattern should be, so it makes a natural target for comparison to models.)   The authors define a DNN correlate for the propertie in terms of the cross-neuron average of the L1-distance between responses to a blank image and responses to a sinuisoid of each contrast and frequency.   They then qualitatively compare the results of this metric for DNNs models to known results from the literature on humans, finding that, like humans, there is an apparent bandpass response for low-contrast gratings and a mostly constant response at high contrast.  

Pros:
    * The general concept of comparing deep nets to psychophysical results in a detailed, quantitative way, is really nice.   

    * They nicely defined a set of ""linking functions"", e.g. metrics that express how a specific behavioral result is to be generated from the neural network.  (Ie. the L1 metrics in results 1 and 3 and the information-theoretic measure in result 2.)   The framework for setting up such linking functions seems like a great direction to me. 

    * The actual psychophysical data seems to have been handled in a very careful and thoughtful way.   These folks clearly know what they're doing on the psychophysical end.  


Cons:
    * To my mind, the biggest problem wit this paper is that that it doesn't say something that we didn't really know already.   Existing results have shown that DNNs are pretty good models of the human visual system in a whole bunch of ways, and this paper adds some more ways.    What would have been great would be: 
         (a) showing that they metric of comparison to humans that was sufficiently sensitive that it could pull apart various DNN models, making one clearly better than the others. 
         (b) identifying a wide gap between the DNNs and the humans that is still unfilled.   They sort of do this, since while the DNNs are good at reproducing the human judgements in Result 1, they are not perfect -- gap is between 60% explained variance and 84% inter-human consistency.    This 24% gap is potentially important, so I'd really like to see them have explored that gap more -- e.g. (i) widening the gap by identifying which images caused the gap most and focusing a test on those, or (ii) closing the gap by training a neural network to get the pattern 100% correct and seeing if that made better CNNs as measured on other metrics/tasks. 

In other words, I would definitely have traded off not having results 2 and 3 for a deeper exploration of result 1.    I think their overall approach could be very fruitful, but it hasn't really been carried far enough here. 

   * I found a few things confusing about the layout of the paper.  I especially found that the quantitative results for results 2 and 3 were not clearly displayed.   Why was figure 8 relegated to the appendix?  Where are the quantifications of model-human similarities for the data shown in Figure 8?  Isn't this the whole meat of their second result?   This should really be presented in a more clear way.    

    * Where is the quantification of model-human similarity for the data show in Figure 3?  Isn't there a way to get the human contrast-sensitivity curve and then compare it to that of models in a more quantitively precise way, rather than just note a qualitative agreement?   It seems odd to me that this wasn't done.

745,False,Human perception in computer vision,"This paper compares the performance, in terms of sensitivity to perturbations, of multilayer neural networks to human vision.  In many of the tasks tested, multilayer neural networks exhibit similar sensitivities as human vision.  

From the tasks used in this paper one may conclude that multilayer neural networks capture many properties of the human visual system.  But of course there are well known adversarial examples in which small, perceptually invisible perturbations cause catastrophic errors in categorization, so against that backdrop it is difficult to know what to make of these results.  That the two systems exhibit similar phenomenologies in some cases could mean any number of things, and so it would have been nice to see a more in depth analysis of why this is happening in some cases and not others.  For example, for the noise perturbations described in the the first section, one sees already that conv2 is correlated with human sensitivity.  So why not examine how the first layer filters are being combined to produce this contextual effect?  From that we might actually learn something about neural mechanisms.

Although I like and am sympathetic to the direction the author is taking here, I feel it just scratches the surface in terms of analyzing perceptual correlates in multilayer neural nets.

746,False,Revisiting Distributed Synchronous SGD,"This paper was easy to read, the main idea was presented very clearly.

The main points of the paper (and my concerns are below) can be summarized as follows:
1. synchronous algoriths suffer from some struggeling nodes, for which the algorithm has to wait. From my own experience, this has never happend for me on e.g. Amazon EC2 cloud, however, it happens on our own cluster at my university, if the cluster is shared and some users make some nodes very busy. So maybe if the nodes would be dedicated to just user's job, it wouldn't be such a big concer (I am not sure what kind of cluster was used to produce Figure 3 and 4). Also how many experiments have you run? In my own experience, most of the time I get the gradient on time from all nodes equality fast, but maybe just in less than 0.1% of iterations I observe that it took maybe twice as long for some node. Also the increasing shape of the curve is somehow implying some weird implementation of communication. Isn't it only because you are somehow serialize the communication? And it would be maybe much faster if a ""MPI_Reduce"" would be used (even if we wait for the slowest guy)?
2. asynchronous algorithms are cutting the waiting time, however, the convergence speed may be slower. Moreover, those algorithms can be divergence it special care is not given to stale gradients. Also they have a nice guarantees for convex functions, but the non-convex DNN may cause pain.
3.they propose to take gradient from the first ""N"" workers out of ""N+b"" 
workers available. My concern here is that they focused only on the 
workers, but what if the ""parameter server"" will became to slow? What 
if the parameter server would be the bottleneck? How would you address 
this situation? But still if the number of nodes (N) is not large, and 
the deep DNN is used, I can imagine that the communciation will not 
take more than 30% of the run-time.


My largest concern is with the experiments. Different batch size 
implies that different learning rate should be chosen, right? How did 
you tune the learning rates and other parameters for e.g. Figure 5 you 
provide some formulas in (A2) but clearly this can bias your Figures, 
right? meaning, that if you tune ""\gamma, \beta"" for each N, it could 
be somehow more representative? also it would be nicer if you run the 
experiment many times and then report average, best and worst case 
behaviour. because now it can be just coinsidence, right?",,6.0,4.0
747,False,Revisiting Distributed Synchronous SGD,"This paper proposed a synchronous parallel SGD by employing several backup machines. The parameter server does not have to wait for the return from all machines to perform the update on the model, which reduce the synchronization overhead. It sounds like a reasonable and straightforward idea. 

My main concern is that this approach is only suitable for some very specific scenario, that is, most learners (except a small number of learners) are at the same pace to return the results. If the efficiency of learners does not follow such distribution, I do not think that the proposed algorithm will work. So I suggest two revisions:

- provide more experiments to show the performance with different efficiency distributions of learners.
- assuming that all learners follow the same distribution of efficiency and show the expected idle time is minor by using the proposed algorithm.",,6.0,4.0
748,False,Revisiting Distributed Synchronous SGD,"The paper claim that, when supported by a number of backup workers, synchronized-SGD 
actually works better than async-SGD. The paper first analyze the problem of staled updates
in async-SGDs, and proposed the sync-SGD with backup workers. In the experiments, the 
authors shows the effectiveness of the proposed method in applications to Inception Net
and PixelCNN.

The idea is very simple, but in practice it can be quite useful in industry settings where 
adding some backup workders is not a big problem in cost. Nevertheless, I think the 
proposed solution is quite straightforward to come up with when we assume that 
each worker contains the full dataset and we have budge to add more workers. So, 
under this setting, it seems quite natural to have a better performance with the additional 
backup workers that avoid the staggering worker problem. And, with this assumtion I'm not 
sure if the proposed solution is solving difficult enough problem with novel enough idea. 

In the experiments, for fair comparison, I think the Async-SGD should also have a mechanism 
to cut off updates of too much staledness just as the proposed method ignores all the remaining 
updates after having N updates. For example, one can measure the average time spent to 
obtain N updates in sync-SGD setting and use that time as the cut-off threashold in Async-SGD 
so that Async-SGD does not perform so poorly.",,5.0,3.0
749,False,Revisiting Distributed Synchronous SGD,"The proposed technique of over-provisioning a few workers to improve the hardware efficiency of synchronous training gives a very welcome boost, as evidenced beautifully by Figure 6.

However, as I have discussed in private communication with the authors, the comparison with asynchronous methods leaves a few questions regarding tuning. 

Learning rate: 

The authors carefully describe the process of tuning the synchronous implementation. However no tuning is reported for the asynchronous implementation: the value is set to 0.045 for all configurations. Figure 7(a) shows that tuning the learning rate can cause a difference of almost a whole percentage point in test precision.
1. What other values of LR have the authors tried for asynchronous training?
2. Is 0.045 the best one for all configurations they report?
3. Is there any chance that the 0.5% difference in precision between sync and async is due to insufficient LR tuning (as suggested by Figure 7(a))?

Performance on a few small tasks show the benefit. It would be nice to see some results on substantial networks and tasks which really need compression on embedded systems (a point made in the introduction).

It is interesting to have a proximal Newton’s method to interpret the different DNN binarization schemes. This gives a new interpretation of existing approaches. However, the theoretical analysis is not very convincing or useful. The formulated optimization problem (3)-(4) is essentially a mixed integer programming. Even though the paper treats the integer part as a constraint and address it in proximal operators, the constraint set is still discrete and there is no guarantee that the proximal Newton algorithm could converge under practically useful conditions.

QNNs are similar to gated RNN , however their gate and state update  functions depend only on the recent input values, it does not depend on the previous hidden state. The gate and state update functions are computed through a temporal convolution applied on the input.
Consequently, QRNN allows for more parallel computation since they have less  operations in their hidden-to-hidden transition depending on the previous hidden state compared to a GRU or LSTM. However, they possibly loose in expressiveness relatively to those models. For instance, it is not clear how such a model deals with long-term dependencies without having to stack up several QRNN layers.

- Address an important problem
- Nice empirical evaluation showing the benefit of their approach
- Demonstrate up to 16x speed-up relatively to a LSTM
Cons:
- Somewhat incremental novelty compared to (Balduzizi et al., 2016)

Few specific questions:
- Is densely layer necessary to obtain good result on the IMDB task. How does a simple 2-layer QRNN compare with 2-layer LSTM?  
- How does the i-fo-ifo pooling perform comparatively? 
- How does QRNN deal with long-term time depency? Did you try on it on simple toy task such as the copy or the adding task? ",,7.0,4.0
755,True,Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks,"The authors describe the use of convolutional layers with intermediate pooling layers to more efficiently model long-range dependencies in sequential data compared with recurrent architectures. Whereas the use of convolutional layers is related to the PixelCNN architecture (Oord et al.), the main novelty is to combine them with gated pooling layers to integrate information from previous time steps. Additionally, the authors describe extensions based on zone-out regularization, densely connected layers, and an efficient attention mechanism for encoder-decoder models. The authors report a striking speed-up over RNNs by up to a factor of 16, while achieving similar or even higher performances.


Major comment
=============
QRNNs are closely related to PixelCNNs, which leverage masked dilated convolutional layers to speed-up computations. However, the authors cite ByteNet, which builds upon PixelCNN, only at the end of their manuscript and do not include it in the evaluation. The authors should cite PixelCNN already when introducing QRNN in the methods sections, and include it in the evaluation. At the very least, QRNN should be compared with ByteNet for language translation. How well does a fully convolutional model without intermediate pooling layers perform, i.e. what is the effect to the introduced pooling layers? Are their performance difference between f, fo, and ifo pooling? Did the authors investigate dilated convolutional layers?


Minor comments
==============
1. How does a model without dense connections perform, i.e. what is the effect of dense connections? To illustrate dense connections, the authors might draw them in figure 1 and refer to it in section 2.1. 

2. The run-time results shown in figure 4 are very helpful, but as far as I understood, the breakdown shown on the left side was measured for language modeling (referred in 3.2), whereas the dependency on batch- and sequence size shown on the right side for sentiment classification (referred in 3.1). I suggest to consistently show the results for either sentiment classification or language modeling, or both. At the very least, the figure caption should describe the task explicitly. Labeling the left and right figure by a) and b) would further improve readability. 

3. Section 3.1 describes a high speed-up for long sequences and small batch sizes. I suggest motivating why this is the case. While computations can be parallelized along the sequence length, it is less obvious why smaller batch sizes speed-up computations.

4. The proposed encoder-decoder attention is different from traditional attention in that attention vectors are not computed and used as input to the decoder sequentially, but on top of decoder output states in parallel. This should be described and motivated in the text.

Sentiment classification
------------------------
5. What was the size of the hold-out development set and how was it created? The text describes that data were split equally into training and test set, without describing the hold-out set.

6. What was the convolutional filter size?

7. What is the speed-up for the best hyper-parameters (batch size 24, sequence length 231)?

8. Figure 3 would be easier to interpret by actually showing the text on the y-axis. For the sake of space, one might use a smaller text passage, plot it along the x-axis, and show the activations of fewer neurons along the y-axis. Showing more examples in the appendix would make the authors’ claim that neurons are interpretable even more convincing.


Language modeling
-----------------
9. What was the size of the training, test, and validation set?

10. What was the convolutional filter size, denoted as ‘k’?

11. Is it correct that a very high learning rate of 1 was used for six epochs at the beginning?

12. The authors should show learning curves for a models with and without zone-out.
 
Translation

13. What was the size of the training, test, and validation set?

14. How does translation performance depend on k?

This paper points out that you can take an LSTM and make the gates only a function of the last few inputs  - h_t = f(x_t, x_{t-1}, ...x_{t-T}) - instead of the standard - h_t = f(x_t, h_{t-1}) -, and that if you do so the networks can run faster and work better. You're moving compute from a serial stream to a parallel stream and also making the serial stream more parallel. Unfortunately, this simple, effective and interesting concept is somewhat obscured by confusing language.

- I would encourage the authors to improve the explanation of the model. 
- Another improvement might be to explicitly go over some of the big Oh calculations, or give an example of exactly where the speed improvements are coming from. 
- Otherwise the experiments seem adequate and I enjoyed this paper.

757,True,Lossy Image Compression with Compressive Autoencoders,"The paper proposes a neural approach to learning an image compression-decompression scheme as an auto-encoder. While the idea is certainly interesting and well-motivated, in practice, it turns out to achieve effectively identical rates to JPEG-2000.

Now, as the authors argue, there is some value to the fact that this scheme was learned automatically rather than by expert design---which means it has benefits beyond the compression of natural images (e.g., it could be used to automatically learning a compression scheme for signals for which we don't have as much domain knowledge). However, I still believe that this makes the paper unsuitable for publication in its current form because of the following reasons---

1. Firstly, the fact that the learned encoder is competitive---and not clearly better---than JPEG 2000 means that the focus of the paper should more be about the aspects in which the encoder is similar to, and the aspects in which it differs, from JPEG 2000. Is it learning similar filters or completely different ones ? For what kinds of textures does it do better and for what kinds does it do worse (the paper could show the best and worst 10 patches at different bit-rates) ?

2. Secondly, I think it's crucial that the paper demonstrate that the benefits come from a better coding scheme (as opposed to just a better decoder), as suggested in my initial pre-review question. How would a decoder trained on JPEG-2000 codes (and perhaps also on encoded random projections) do worse or better ?

3. Finally, I think the fact that it does as well/worse than JPEG-2000 significantly diminishes the case for using a 'deep' auto-encoder. JPEG-2000 essentially uses a wavelet transform, which is a basis that past studies have shown could be recovered using a simple sparse dictionary algorithm like K-SVD. This is why I feel that the method needs to clearly outperform JPEG-2000, or show comparisons to (or atleast discuss) a well-crafted traditional/generative model-based baseline.",,5.0,4.0
758,True,Lossy Image Compression with Compressive Autoencoders,"Thank you for the important work. I'm trying to reproduce the results.

The loss function in eq 2. scales the distortion by a beta hyper parameter. In your experiment you mention training three variants, high bit-rate: beta=0.01, medium: 0.05 and low: 0.2

So, the high bit-rate variant weights the distortion the least? That does not make sense to me. Did you mean 1/0.01, 1/0.05 and 1/0.2 or something else?

Also, figure 3 B shows the loss on the y-axis. This goes from 0.01 to 0.03. How can the loss be so low if it includes -logQ, which from figure 4 seems to be around 0.3 to 2.0 (bpp), if I'm interpreting this right.

760,True,Lossy Image Compression with Compressive Autoencoders,"This paper proposes an autoencoder approach to lossy image compression by minimizing the weighted sum of reconstruction error and code length. The architecture consists of a convolutional encoder and a sub-pixel convolutional decoder. Experiments compare PSNR, SSIM, and MS-SSIM performance against JPEG, JPEG-2000, and a recent RNN-based compression approach. A mean opinion score test was also conducted.

Pros:
+ The paper is clear and well-written.
+ The decoder architecture takes advantage of recent advances in convolutional approaches to image super-resolution.
+ The proposed approaches to quantization and rate estimation are sensible and well-justified.

Cons:
- The experimental baselines do not appear to be entirely complete.

The task of using autoencoders to perform compression is important and has a large practical impact. Though directly optimizing the rate-distortion tradeoff is not an entirely novel enterprise, there are enough differences (e.g. the quantization approach and sub-pixel convolutional decoder) to sufficiently distinguish this from earlier work. I am not an image compression expert but the approach and results both seem compelling. The main shortcoming is that the implementation of Toderici et al. 2016b appears to be incomplete, and there is no comparison to Balle et al. 2016. Overall, I feel that the fact that this architecture achieves competitive performance with JPEG-2000 while simultaneously setting the stage for future work that varies the encoder/decoder size and data domain means the community will find this work to be of significant interest.

761,True,Lossy Image Compression with Compressive Autoencoders,"Thank you for this important and inspiring work.

I have some questions regarding the bound in eq. 8.

My understanding:

The bound in eq. 8 is used in the loss function as a proxy for the non-differentiable entropy of the codes. If the bound is minimized, a bound on the entropy is minimized.

The bound in eq. 8 comes directly from the equality in eq. 7, by applying Jensen's inequality. So, the bound only holds if the equality in eq. 7 holds.

However, q(z+u) is a parametric approximation (the GSM model) of Q(z), not an equality.

Does the bound still hold? Under which circumstances?

(I have a feeling that the missing term on the RHS of eq. 8 to make the bound an equality is a KL term between int q(z+u) du and Q(z), in which case the bound still holds as the KL is positive, but I have not been able to show it.)

2. What was the intuition for incremental training? Do you have some insights why incremental manner is beneficial for training? Also, for figure 3B, it seems that the loss are not quite stable before 100 thousand iterations but suddenly the loss become very stable. Is this due to decreased learning rate at that point?

763,False,Regularizing Neural Networks by Penalizing Confident Output Distributions,"The authors propose a simple idea. They penalize confident predictions by using the entropy of the predictive distribution as a regularizer. The authors consider two variations on this idea. In one, they penalize the divergence from the uniform distribution. In the other variation, they penalize distance from the base rates. They term this variation ""unigram"" but I find the name odd as I've never seen multi-class labels described as unigrams before. What would a bigram be? 

The idea is simple,  and while it's been used in the context of reinforcement learning, it hasn't been popularized as a regularizer for improving generalization in supervised learning. 

The justifications for the idea still lacks analysis. And the author responses comparing it to L2 regularization have some holes. A simple number line example with polynomial regression makes clear how L2 regularization could prevent a model from badly overfitting to accommodate every data point. In contrast, it seems trivial to fit every data point and satisfy arbitrarily high entropy. Of course, the un-regularized optimization is to maximize log likelihood, not simply to maximize accuracy.  And perhaps something interesting may be happening at the interplay between the log likelihood objective and the regularization objective. But the paper doesn't indicate precisely what.

I could imagine the following scenario: when the network outputs probabilities near 0, it can get high loss (if the label is 1). The entropy regularization could be stabilizing the gradient, preventing sharp loss on outlier examples. The regularization then might owe mainly to faster convergence. Could the authors analyze the effect empirically, on the distribution of the gradient norms? 

The strength of this paper is its empirical rigor. The authors take their idea and put it through its paces on a host of popular and classic benchmarks spanning CNNs and RNNs. It appears that on some datasets, especially language modeling, the confidence penalty outperforms label smoothing. 

At present, I rate this paper as a borderline contribution but I'm open to revising my review pending further modifications.

The paper should report the state-of-the-art results for speech recognition tasks (TIMIT, WSJ), even if models are not directly comparable.
The error back-propagation of label smoothing through softmax is straightforward and efficient. Is there an efficient solution for BP of the entropy smoothing through softmax?
Although the classification accuracy could remain the same, the model will not estimate the true posterior distribution with this kind of smoothing.
This might be an issue in complex machine learning problems where the decision is made on higher level and based on the posterior estimations, e.g. language models in speech recognition.

765,True,Structured Attention Networks,"The authors propose to extend the “standard” attention mechanism, by extending it to consider a distribution over latent structures (e.g., alignments, syntactic parse trees, etc.). These latent variables are modeled as a graphical model with potentials derived from a neural network.

The paper is well-written and clear to understand. The proposed methods are evaluated on various problems, and in each case the “structured attention” models outperform baseline models (either one without attention, or using simple attention). For the two real-world tasks, the improvements obtained from the proposed approach are relatively small compared to the “simple” attention models, but the techniques are nonetheless interesting.

Main comments:
1. In the Japanese-English Machine Translation example, the relative difference in performance between the Sigmoid attention model, and the Structured attention model appears to be relatively small. In this case, I’m curious if the authors analyzed the attention alignments to determine whether the structured models resulted in better alignments. In other words, if ground-truth alignments are available for the dataset, or if they can be human-annotated for some test examples, it would be interesting to measure the quality of the alignments in addition to the BLEU metric.
2. In the final experiment on natural language inference, I thought it was a bit surprising that using pretrained syntactic attention layers did not appear to improve model performance, but instead appear to degrade performance. I was curious if the authors have any hypotheses for why this is the case?

766,True,Structured Attention Networks,"This is a very nice paper. The writing of the paper is clear. It starts from the traditional attention mechanism case. By interpreting the attention variable z as a distribution conditioned on the input x and query q, the proposed method naturally treat them as latent variables in graphical models. The potentials are computed using the neural network.

Under this view, the paper shows traditional dependencies between variables (i.e. structures) can be modeled explicitly into attentions. This enables the use of classical graphical models such as CRF and semi-markov CRF in the attention mechanism to capture the dependencies naturally inherit in the linguistic structures.

The experiments of the paper prove the usefulness of the model in various level — seq2seq and tree structure etc. I think it’s solid and the experiments are carefully done. It also includes careful engineering such as normalizing the marginals in the model.

In sum, I think this is a solid contribution and the approach will benefit the research in other problems.
",,8.0,4.0
767,True,Structured Attention Networks,"This is a solid paper that proposes to endow attention mechanisms with structure (the attention posterior probabilities becoming structured latent variables). Experiments are shown with segmental atention (as in semi-Markov models) and syntactic attention (as in projective dependency parsing), both in a synthetic task (tree transduction) and real world tasks (neural machine translation and natural language inference). There is a small gain in using structured attention over simple attention in the latter tasks. A clear accept.

The paper is very clear, the approach is novel and interesting, and the experiments seem to give a good proof of concept. However, the use of structured attention in neural MT seems doesn't seem to be fully exploited here: segmental attention could be a way of approaching neural phrase-based MT, and syntactic attention offers a way of incorporating latent syntax in MT -- these seem very promising directions. In particular it would be interesting to try to add some (semi-)supervision on these attention mechanisms (e.g. posterior marginals computed by an external parser) to see if that helps learning the attention components of the network, or at least help initializing them. 

This seems to be the first interesting use of the backprop of forward-backward/inside-outside (Stoyanov et al. 2011). As stated in sec 3.3., for general probabilistic models the forward step over structured attention corresponds to the computation of first-order moments (posterior marginals) while the backprop step corresponds to second-order moments (gradients of marginals wrt log-potentials, i.e., Hessian of log-partition function). This extends the applicability of the proposed approach to arbitrary graphical models where these quantities can be computed efficiently. E.g. is there a generalized matrix-tree formula that allows to do backprop for non-projective syntax? On the negative side, I suspect the need for second-order statistics may bring some numerical instability in some problems, caused by the use of the signed log-space field. Was this seen in practice?

768,False,HFH: Homologically Functional Hashing for Compressing Deep Neural Networks,"The paper describes an extension of the HasheNets work, with several novel twists. Instead of using a single hash function, the proposed HFH approach uses multiple hash function to associate each ""virtual"" (to-be-synthesized) weight location to several components of an underlying parameter vector (shared across all layers). These components are then passed through a small MLP to synthesize the final weight.

This is an interesting and novel idea, and the experiments demonstrate that it improves substantially over HashedNets. However, HashedNets is not a particularly compelling technique for neural network model compression, especially when compared with more recent work on pruning- and quantization-based approaches. The experiments in this paper demonstrate that the proposed approach yields worse accuracy at the same compression ratios as pruning-based approaches, while providing no runtime speedup benefits. While the authors mention the technique is only 20% slower (which I am pleasantly surprised by), I don't understand why this technique should ever be used over competing approaches for the kinds of networks the authors present experimental results on. The authors suggest that the technique could be combined with pruning based approaches... this may be true, but no experiments to this effect are provided. The paper also suggests that ease of setting the compression ratio is a benefit of HFH, but I don't think that's a sufficient win to justify the numerous other downsides (in accuracy and speed). 

In response to a question, the authors point out that the technique works very well for compressing embeddings, and for this setting the technique does appear like a genuinely useful contribution, given the marginal overhead and substantial train-time benefits. If the paper focused on this setting and showed experimental results on e.g. language modeling tasks or other scenarios with high-dimensional sparse/one-hot inputs require large embedding layers, I could enthusiastically recommend acceptance.

For hashed net, this is quite simple, yet it created an additional bottleneck.  Please also show the impact on running time.

In this paper, some new tricks are proposed including: (1) the compression space is shared among the layers of the neural network (2) multiple hash functions are used to reduce the effects of collisions (3) a small network is used to combine the elements retrieved from multiple hash tables into a single parameter.

Although the baselines are less strong than those presented in the literature, the paper claims significant error reduction for both ImageNet and CIFAR-100.

If it's from a different training regime (fewer iterations, for instance), did the authors confirm that running  their replication to the same settings as Mnih et al provide similar results?

- It is intriguing that the best results of FiGAR are reported on games where few actions repeat dominate. This seems to imply that for those, the performance overhead of FiGAR over A3C is high since A3C uses an action repeat of 4 (and therefore has 4 times fewer gradient updates). A3C could be run for a comparable computation cost with a lower action repeat, which would probably result in increased performance of A3C.  Nevertheless,  the automatic determination of the appropriate action repeat is interesting, even if the overall message seems to be to not repeat actions too often.

- Slightly problematic notation, where r sometimes denotes rewards, sometimes denotes elements of the repetition set R (top of page 5)

- In the equation at the bottom of page 5 - since the sum is not indexed over decision steps, not time steps, shouldn't the rewards r_k be modified to be the sum of rewards (appropriately discounted) between those time steps?

- The section on DDPG is confusingly written. ""Concatenating"" loss is a strange operation; doesn't FiGAR correspond to a loss to roughly looks like Q(x,mu(x)) + R log p(x) (with separate loss for learning the critic)? It feels that REINFORCE should be applied for the repetition variable x (second term of the sum) and reparametrization for the action a (first term)? 

- Is the 'name_this_game' name in the tables  intentional?

- A potential weakness of the method is that the agent must decide to commit to an action for a fixed number of steps, independently of what happens next. Have the authors considered a scheme in which, at each time step, the agent decides to stick with the current decision or not? (It feels like it might be a relatively simple modification of FiGAR).",,7.0,3.0
777,True,Learning to Repeat: Fine Grained Action Repetition for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"This paper shows that extending deep RL algorithms to decide which action to take as well as how many times to repeat it leads to improved performance on a number of domains. The evaluation is very thorough and shows that this simple idea works well in both discrete and continuous actions spaces.

A few comments/questions:
- Table 1 could be easier to interpret as a figure of histograms.
- Figure 3 could be easier to interpret as a table.
- How was the subset of Atari games selected?
- The Atari evaluation does show convincing improvements over A3C on games requiring extended exploration (e.g. Freeway and Seaquest), but it would be nice to see a full evaluation on 57 games. This has become quite standard and would make it possible to compare overall performance using mean and median scores.
- It would also be nice to see a more direct comparison to the STRAW model of Vezhnevets et al., which aims to solve some of the same problems as FiGAR.
- FiGAR currently discards frames between action decisions. There might be a tradeoff between repeating an action more times and throwing away more information. Have you thought about separating these effects? You could train a model that does process intermediate frames. Just a thought.

Overall, this is a nice simple addition to deep RL algorithms that many people will probably start using.

778,True,Learning to Repeat: Fine Grained Action Repetition for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"This paper proposes a simple but effective extension to reinforcement learning algorithms, by adding a temporal repetition component as part of the action space, enabling the policy to select how long to repeat the chosen action for. The extension applies to all reinforcement learning algorithms, including both discrete and continuous domains, as it is primarily changing the action parametrization. The paper is well-written, and the experiments extensively evaluate the approach with 3 different RL algorithms in 3 different domains (Atari, MuJoCo, and TORCS).

Here are some comments and questions, for improving the paper:

The introduction states that ""all DRL algorithms repeatedly execute a chosen action for a fixed number of time steps k"". This statement is too strong, and is actually disproved in the experiments — repeating an action is helpful in many tasks, but not in all tasks. The sentence should be rephrased to be more precise.

In the related work, a discussion of the relation to semi-MDPs would be useful to help the reader better understand the approach and how it compares and differs (e.g. the response from the pre-review questions)

Experiments:
Can you provide error bars on the experimental results? (from running multiple random seeds)

It would be useful to see experiments with parameter sharing in the TRPO experiments, to be more consistent with the other domains, especially since it seems that the improvement in the TRPO experiments is smaller than that of the other two domains. Right now, it is hard to tell if the smaller improvement is because of the nature of the task, because of the lack of parameter sharing, or something else.

The TRPO evaluation is different from the results reported in Duan et al. ICML ’16. Why not use the same benchmark?

Videos only show the policies learned with FiGAR, which are uninformative without also seeing the policies learned without FiGAR. Can you also include videos of the policies learned without FiGAR, as a comparison point?

How many laps does DDPG complete without FiGAR? The difference in reward achieved seems quite substantial (557K vs. 59K).

Can the tables be visualized as histograms? This seems like it would more effectively and efficiently communicate the results.

Minor comments:
-- On the plot in Figure 2, the label for the first bar should be changed from 1000 to 3500.
-- “idea of deciding when necessary” - seems like it would be better to say “idea of only deciding when necessary""
-- ""spaces.Durugkar et al.” — missing a space.
-- “R={4}” — why 4? Could you use a letter to indicate a constant instead? (or a different notation)

779,True,Learning to Repeat: Fine Grained Action Repetition for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Hi, the main idea is quite interesting. I was curious about the following. My primary question is Q1, and others are predominantly comments.

Q1: After learning is complete, did you try forward propagating through the network to find actions for every time-step as opposed to repeating actions? Concretely, if at t=5, action suggested by the network is a_3 with a repetition of 4, instead of sticking with a_3 for times t={5,6,7,8} perform action a_3 for just t=5, and forward prop through the policy again at t=6.

I understand that the goal is to explore temporal abstractions, but for all the problems considered in this paper, a forward prop is not expensive at all. Hence, there is no computational bottle neck forcing action repetition during test-time. It is understandable that repeating actions speeds up training. However, at test time, the performance can potentially improve by not repeating. This idea is quite popular in variants of Receding Horizon Control and MCTS.

2: Can you share hyper-parameter settings of section 5.2? How many iterations of TRPO was run, and how many trajectory samples per iteration? The performance on Ant-v1 task is too low for both TRPO and FIGAR. Running for more iterations and initializing the network better (smaller weights) might improve performance significantly for both. It might be informative to share the learning curves comparing FIGAR with TRPO. With the current results, it is a stretch to say that FIGAR ""outperforms"" TRPO.

3: Considering that the action repetition is 1 for a majority of MuJoCo tasks (discounting Ant) and TORCS, why do you expect FIGAR to perform better? Also, the FIGAR policies seem to have more parameters than baselines they are compared against -- is this true? Have you compared to baselines with equal number of parameters?",,,
780,False,Submodular Sum-product Networks for Scene Understanding,"This paper develops Submodular Sum Product Networks (SSPNs) and
an efficient inference algorithm for approximately computing the
most probable labeling of variables in the model. The main
application in the paper is on scene parsing. In this context,
SSPNs define an energy function with a grammar component for
representing a hierarchy of labels and an MRF for encoding
smoothness of labels over space. To perform inference, the
authors develop a move-making algorithm, somewhat in the spirit
of fusion moves (Lempitsky et al., 2010) that repeatedly improves
a solution by considering a large neighborhood of alternative segmentations
and solving an optimization problem to choose the best neighbor.
Empirical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better
energy that belief propagation of alpha expansion and is much faster.

This is generally a well-executed paper. The model is interesting
and clearly defined, the algorithm is well presented with proper
analysis of the relevant runtimes and guarantees on the
behavior. Overall, the algorithm seems effective at minimizing
the energy of SSPN models.

Having said that, I don't think this paper is a great fit for
ICLR. The model is even somewhat to the antithesis of the idea of
learning representations, in that a highly structured form of
energy function is asserted by the human modeller, and then
inference is performed. I don't see the connection to learning
representations. One additional issue is that while the proposed
algorithm is faster than alternatives, the times are still on the
order of 1-287 seconds per image, which means that the
applicability of this method (as is) to something like training
ConvNets is limited.

Finally, there is no attempt to argue that the model produces
better segmentations than alternative models. The only
evaluations in the paper are on energy values achieved and on
training data.

So overall I think this is a good paper that should be published
at a good machine learning conference, but I don't think ICLR is
the right fit.",,4.0,3.0

Summary:
———
I think the paper presents a compelling technique for hierarchical reasoning in MRFs but the experimental results are not yet convincing. Moreover the writing is confusing at times. See below for details.

Quality: I think some of the techniques could be described more carefully to better convey the intuition.
Clarity: Some of the derivations and intuitions could be explained in more detail.
Originality: The suggested idea is great.
Significance: Since the experimental setup is somewhat limited according to my opinion, significance is hard to judge at this point in time.

Detailed comments:
———
1. I think the clarity of the paper would benefit significantly from fixes to inaccuracies. E.g., \alpha-expansion and belief propagation are not `scene-understanding algorithms’ but rather approaches for optimizing energy functions. Computing the MAP state of an SSPN in time sub-linear in the network size seems counterintuitive because it means we are not allowed to visit all the nodes in the network. The term `deep probabilistic model’ should probably be defined. The paper states that InferSSPN computes `the approximate MAP state of the SSPN (equivalently, the optimal parse of the image)’ and I’m wondering how the `approximate MAP state' can be optimal. Etc.

2. Albeit being formulated for scene understanding tasks, no experiments demonstrate the obtained results of the proposed technique. To assess the applicability of the proposed approach a more detailed analysis is required. More specifically, the technique is evaluated on a subset of images which makes comparison to any other approach impossible. According to my opinion, either a conclusive experimental evaluation using, e.g., IoU metric should be given in the paper, or a comparison to publicly available results is possible.

3. To simplify the understanding of the paper a more intuitive high-level description is desirable. Maybe the authors can even provide an intuitive visualization of their approach.",,5.0,4.0
782,False,Submodular Sum-product Networks for Scene Understanding,"This paper is about submodular sum product networks applied to scene understanding. SPNs have shown great success in deep linear models since the work of Poon 2011.  The authors propose an extension to the initial SPNs model to be submodular, introducing submodular unary and pairwise potentials.  The authors propose a new inference algorithm. The authors evaluated their results on Stanford Background Dataset and compared against multiple baselines.

Pros:
+ New formulation of SPNs 
+ New inference algorithm

Cons:
- The authors did not discuss how the SSPN structure is learned and how the generative process chooses the a symbol (operation) at each level)
- The evaluations is lacking. The authors only showed results on their own approach and baselines, leaving out every other approach. Evaluations could have been also done on BSD for regular image segmentation (hierarchical segmentation). 

The idea is great, however, the paper needs more work to be published.  I would also recommend for the authors to include more details about their approach and present a full paper with extended experiments and full learning approach.",,4.0,3.0
783,False,Learning Efficient Algorithms with Hierarchical Attentive Memory,"The authors introduce a new memory model which allows memory access in O(log n) time.

Pros:
* The paper is well written and everything is clear.
* It's a new model and I'm not aware of a similar model.
* It's clear that memory access time is an issue for longer sequences and it is clear how this model solves this problem.

Cons:
* The motivation for O(log n) access time is to be able to use the model on very long sequences. While it is clear from the definition that the computation time is low because of its design, it is not clear that the model will really generalize well to very long sequences.
* The model was also not tested on any real-world task.

I think such experiments should be added to show whether the model really works on long sequences and real-world tasks, otherwise it is not clear if this is a useful model.",,5.0,4.0
784,False,Learning Efficient Algorithms with Hierarchical Attentive Memory,"This paper introduces a novel hierarchical memory architecture for neural networks, based on a binary tree with leaves corresponding to memory cells.  This allows for O(log n) memory access, and experiments additionally demonstrate ability to solve more challenging tasks such as sorting from pure input-output examples and dealing with longer sequences.

The idea of the paper is novel and well-presented, and the memory structure seems reasonable to have advantages in practice. However, the main weakness of the paper is the experiments. There is no experimental comparison with other external memory-based approaches (e.g. those discussed in Related Work), or experimental analysis of computational efficiency given overhead costs (beyond just computational complexity) despite that being one of the main advantages. Furthermore, the experimental setups are relatively weak, all on artificial tasks with moderate increases in sequence length.  Improving on these would greatly strengthen the paper, as the core idea is interesting.",,5.0,5.0
785,False,Learning Efficient Algorithms with Hierarchical Attentive Memory,"This paper proposes to use a hierarchical softmax to speed up attention based memory addressing in memory augmented network (e.g. NTM, memNN…).

The model build a hierarchical softmax on top of the input sequence then at each time step SEARCH for the most relevant input to predict the next output (this search is discrete), and use its corresponding embedding to update the state of an LSTM that will then produce the output. Finally the embedding of the used input is update by a WRITE function (an LSTM working that takes hidden state of the other LSTM as an input). The model has a discrete component (the SEARCH) and is thus trained with REINFORCE. In the experimental section they test their approach on several algorithmic tasks such as search, sort...

The main advantage of replacing the full softmax by a hierarchical softmax is that during inference, the complexity goes from O(N) to O(log(N)). It would be great to see if the gain in complexity allows to tackle problem which are a few orders of magnitude bigger than the one addressed with full softmax. However the authors only test on toy sequences up to 32 tokens, which is quite small. 

The model requires a relatively complex search mechanism that can only be trained with REINFORCE. While this seems to work on problems with relatively small and simple sequences, it would be great to see how performance changes with the size of the problem. 

Overall, while the idea of replacing the softmax in the attention mechanism by a hierachical softmax is appealing, this work is not quite convincing yet. Their approach is not very natural, may be hard to train and may not be that simple to scale. The experiment section is very weak.

786,False,An Analysis of Deep Neural Network Models for Practical Applications,"A few issues with this paper:
1- I find finding #2 trivial and unworthy of mention, but the author don't seem to agree with me that it is. See discussions.
2- Finding #1 relies on Fig #4, which appears very noisy and doesn't provide any error analysis. It makes me question how robust this finding is. One would have naively expected the power usage trend to mirror Fig #3, but given the level of noise, I can't convince myself whether the null hypothesis of there being no dependency between batch size and power consumption is more likely than the alternative.
3- Paper is unfriendly to colorblind readers (or those with B/W printers)

Overall, this paper is a reasonable review of where we are in terms of SOTA vision architectures, but doesn't provide much new insight. I found most interesting the clear illustration that VGG models stand out in terms of being a bad tradeoff in resource-constrained environments (too many researchers are tempted to benchmark their model compression algorithm on VGG-class models because that's always where one can show 10x improvements without doing much.)",,5.0,4.0
787,False,An Analysis of Deep Neural Network Models for Practical Applications,"The paper evaluates recent development in competitive ILSVRC CNN architectures from the perspective of resource utilization. It is clear that a lot of work has been put into the evaluations. The findings are well presented and the topic itself is important.

However, most of the results are not surprising to people working with CNNs on a regular basis. And even if they are, I am not convinced about their practical value. It is hard to tell what we actually learn from these findings when approaching new problems with computational constraints or when in production settings. In my opinion, this is mainly because the paper does not discuss realistic circumstances.

Main concerns:
1) The evaluation does not tell me much for realistic scenarios, that mostly involve fine-tuning networks, as ILSVRC is just a starting point in most cases. VGG for instance really shines for fine-tuning, but it is cumbersome to train from scratch. And VGG works well for compression, too. So possibly it is a very good choice if these by now standard steps are taken into account. Such questions are of high practical relevance!

2) Compressed networks have a much higher acc/parameter density, so comparison how well models can be compressed is important, or at least comparing to some of the most well-known and publicly available compressed networks.

3) There is no analysis on the actual topology of the networks and where the bottlenecks lie. This would be very useful to have as well.

Minor concern:
1) Why did the authors choose to use batch normalization in NiN and AlexNet?",,4.0,3.0
788,False,An Analysis of Deep Neural Network Models for Practical Applications,"The authors did solid work in collecting all the reported data. However, most findings don't seem to be too surprising to me:

- Finding #1 mainly shows that all architectures and batch sizes manage to utilize the GPU fully (or to the same percentage).

- Regarding Finding #2, I agree that from a linear relationship in Figure 9 you could conclude said hyperbolic relationship.
However, for this finding to be relevant, it has to hold especially for the latest generations of models. These cluster in the upper left corner of Figure 9 and on their own do not seem to show too much of a linear behaviour. Therefore I think there is not enough evidence to conclude asymptotic hyperbolic behaviour: For this the linear behaviour would have to be the stronger, the more models approach the upper left corner.

- Finding #3 seems to be a simple conclusion from finding #1: As long as slower models are better and faster models do draw the same power, finding #3 holds.

- Finding #4 is again similar to finding #1: If all architectures manage to fully utilize the GPU, inference time should be proportional to the number of operations.

Maybe the most interesting finding would be that all tested models seem to use the same percentage of computational resources available on the GPU, while one might expect that more complex models don't manage to utilize as much computational resources due to inter-dependencies. However actual GPU utilization was not evaluated and as the authors choose to use an older GPU, one would expect that all models manage to make use of all available computational power.

Additionally, I think these findings would have to be put in relation with compressing techniques or tested on actual production networks to be of more interest.

789,True,Sigma Delta Quantized Networks,"This is an interesting paper about quantized networks that work on temporal difference inputs.  The basic idea is that when a network has only to process differences then this is computational much more efficient specifically with natural video data since large parts of an image would be fairly constant so that the network only has to process the informative sections of the image (video stream). This is of course how the human visual system works, and it is hence of interest even beyond the core machine learning community. 

As an aside, there is a strong community interested in event-based vision such as the group of Tobi Delbrück, and it might be interesting to connect to this community. This might even provide a reference for your comments on page 1.

I guess the biggest novel contribution is that a rounding network can be replaced by a sigma-delta network, but that the order of discretization and summation doe make some difference in the actual processing load. I think I followed the steps and 
Most of my questions have already been answers in the pre-review period. My only question remaining is on page 3, “It should be noted that when we refer to “temporal differences”, we refer not to the change in the signal over time, but in the change between two inputs presented sequentially. The output of our network only depends on the value and order of inputs, not on the temporal spacing between them.”

This does not make sense to me. As I understand you just take the difference between two frames regardless if you call this temporal or not it is a change in one frame. So this statement rather confuses me and maybe should be dropped unless I do miss something here, in which case some more explanation would be necessary.

Figure 1 should be made bigger.

The improvement is naturally limited by the ‘slowness’ of the CNN representation that is transformed into a sigma-delta network: CNNs that are specifically designed to have ‘slow’ representations will benefit most. Also, it is likely that only specialised hardware can fully harness the improved efficiency achieved by the proposed method. Thus as of now, the full potential of the method cannot be thoroughly evaluated.

792,False,Chess Game Concepts Emerge under Weak Supervision: A Case Study of Tic-tac-toe,"Summary
===
This paper presents tic-tac-toe as toy problem for investigating CNNs.
A dataset is created containing tic-tac-toe boards where one player is one
move away from winning and a CNN is trained to label boards according
to (1) the player who can win (2 choices) and (2) the position they may move
to win (9 choices), resulting in 18 labels. The CNN evaluated in this paper
performs perfectly at the task and the paper's goal is to inspect how the
CNN works.

The fundamental mechanism for this inspection is Class Activation
Mapping (CAM) (Zhou et. al. 2016), which identifies regions of implicit attention
in the CNN. These implicit attention maps (localization heat maps) are used to
derive actions (which square each player should move). The attention maps  

(1) attend to squares in the tic-tac-toe board rather than arbitrary
blobs, despite the fact that one square in a board has uniform color, and

(2) they can be used to pick correct (winning) actions.

This experiment are used to support assertions that the network understands
(1) chess (tic-tac-toe) boards
(2) a rule for winning tic-tac-toe
(3) that there are two players.

Some follow up experiments indicate similar results under various renderings
of the tic-tac-toe boards and an incomplete training regime.


More Clarifying Questions
===

* I am not quite sure precisely how CAM is implemented here. In the original CAM
one must identify a class of interest to visualize (e.g., cat or dog). I don't
think this paper identifies such a choice. How is one of the 18 possible classes
chosen for creating the CAM visualization and through that visualization
choosing an action?

* How was the test set for this dataset for the table 1 results created?
How many of the final 1029 states were used for test and was the
distribution of labels the same in train and test?

* How is RCO computed? Is rank correlation or Pearson correlation used?
If Pearson correlation is used then it may be good to consider rank correlation,
as argued in ""Human Attention in Visual Question Answering: Do Humans and
Deep Networks Look at the Same Regions?"" by Das et. al. in EMNLP 2016.
In table 1, what does the 10^3 next to RCO mean?


Pros
===

* The proposed method, deriving an action to take from the result of a
visualization technique, is very novel.

* This paper provides an experiment that clearly shows a CNN relying on context
to make accurate predictions.

* The use of a toy tic-tac-toe domain to study attention in CNNs
(implicit or otherwise) is a potentially fruitful setting that may
lead to better understanding of implicit and maybe explicit attention mechanisms.


Cons
===

* This work distinguishes between predictions about ""what will happen""
(will the white player win?) and ""what to do"" (where should the white
player move to win?). The central idea is generalization from ""what will happen""
to ""what to do"" indicates concept learning (sec. 2.1). Why should an ability to
act be any more indicative of a learned concept than an ability to predict
future states. I see a further issue with the presentation of this approach and
a potential correctness problem:

1. (correctness)
In the specific setting proposed I see no difference between ""what to do""
and ""what will happen.""

Suppose one created labels dictating ""what to do"" for each example in the
proposed dataset. How would these differ from the labels of ""what will happen""
in the proposed dataset? In this case ""what will happen"" labels include
both player identity (who wins) and board position (which position they move
to win). Wouldn't the ""what to do"" labels need to indicate board position?
They could also chosen to indicate player identity, which would make them
identical to the ""what will happen"" labels (both 18-way softmaxes).

2. (presentation)
I think this distinction would usually be handled by the Reinforcement Learning
framework, but the proposed method is not presented in that framework or
related to an RL based approach. In RL ""what will happen"" is the reward an
agent will receive for making a particular action and ""what to do"" is the
action an agent should take. From this point of view, generalization from
""what will happen"" to ""what to do"" is not a novel thing to study.

Alternate models include:
    * A deep Q network (Mnih. et. al. 2015) could predict the value of
      every possible action where an action is a (player, board position) tuple.
    * The argmax of the current model's softmax could be used as an action
      prediction.
The deep Q network approach need not be implemented, but differences between
methods should be explained because of the uniqueness of the proposed approach.


* Comparison to work that uses visualization to investigate deep RL networks
is missing. In particular, other work in RL has used Simonyan et. al.
(arXiv 2013) style saliency maps to investigate network behavior. For example, 
""Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning"" by Wang et. al.
in (ICML 2016) uses saliency maps to identify differences between their
state-value and advantage networks. In ""Graying the black box:
Understanding DQNs"" by Zahavy et. al. (ICML 2016) these saliency maps are
also used to analyze network behavior.


* In section 2.3, saliency maps of Simonyan et. al. are said to not be able to
activate on grid squares because they have constant intensity, yet no empirical
or theoretical evidence is provided for this claim.

On a related note, what precisely is the notion of information referenced in
section 2.3 and why is it relevant? Is it entropy of the distribution of pixel
intensities in a patch? To me it seems that any measure which depends only
on one patch is irrelevant because the methods discussed (e.g., saliency maps)
depend on context as well as the intensities within a patch.


* The presentation in the paper would be improved if the results in section 7
were presented along with relevant discussion in preceding sections.


Overall Evaluation

The experiments presented here are novel, but I am not sure they are very

clearly and lack the broader relevant context mentioned above. Furthermore, I
find the lines of thought mentioned in the Cons section possibly incorrect

793,False,Chess Game Concepts Emerge under Weak Supervision: A Case Study of Tic-tac-toe,"Game of tic-tac-toe is considered. 1029 tic-tac-toe board combinations are chosen so that a single move will result into victory of either the black or the white player. There are 18 possible moves - 2 players x 9 locations. A CNN is trained from a visual rendering of the game board to these 18 possible outputs. CAM technique is used to visualize the salient regions in the inputs responsible for the prediction that CNN makes. Authors find that predictions correspond to the winning board locations. 

Authors claim that this:
1. is a very interesting finding. 
2. CNN has figured out game rules. 
3. Cross modal supervision is applicable to higher-level semantics. 

I don't think (2) be can be claimed because the knowledge of game rules is not tested by any experiment. There is only ""one"" stage of a game - i.e. last move that is considered. Further, the results are on the training set itself - the bare minimum requirement of any implicit or explicit representation of game rules is the ability to act in previously unseen states (i.e. generalization). Even if the CNN did generalize, I would avoid making any claims about knowledge of game rules. 

For (3), author's definition of cross-modal seems to be training from images to games moves. In image-classification we go from images --> labels (i.e. between two different domains). We already know CNNs can perform such mappings. CNNs have been used to map images to actions such as in DQN my Mnih et al., or DDPG by Lillicrap et al. and a lot of other classical work such as ALVIN. It's unclear what points authors are trying to make. 

For (1): how interesting is an implicit attention mechanism is a subjective matter. The authors claim a difference between the concepts of ""what do do"" and ""what will happen"". They claim by supervising for ""what will happen"", the CNN can automatically learn about ""what to do"". This is extensively studied in the model predictive control literature. Where model is ""what will happen next"", and the model is used to infer a control law - ""what to do"". However, in the experimental setup presented in the paper what will happen and what to do seem to be the exact same things. 

For further analysis of what the CNN has learnt I would recommend:
(a) Visualizing CAM with respect to incorrect classes. For eg, visualize the CAM with respect to player would lose (instead of winning).

(b) Split the data into train/val and use the predictions on the val-set for visualization. These would be much more informative about what kind of ""generalizable"" features the CNN pays attention to. 

In summary, understanding why CNN's make what decisions they make is a very interesting area of research. While the emergence of an implicit attention mechanism may be considered to be an interesting finding by some, many claims made by the authors are not supported by experiments (see comments above).

794,False,Chess Game Concepts Emerge under Weak Supervision: A Case Study of Tic-tac-toe,"1029 tic-tac-toe boards are rendered (in various ways). These 1029 boards are legal boards where the next legal play can end the game. There are 18 categories of such boards -- 9 for the different locations of the next play, and 2 for the color of the next play. The supervision is basically saying ""If you place a black square in the middle right, black will win"" or ""if you place a white square in the upper left, white will win"". A CNN is trained to predict these 18 categories and can do so with 100% accuracy.

The focus of the paper is using Zhou et al's Class Activation Mapping to show where the CNN focuses when making it's decision. As I understand it, an input to CAM is the class of interest. So let's say it is class 1 (black wins with a play to the bottom right square, if I've deciphered figure 2 correctly. Figure 2 should really be more clear about what each class is). So we ask CAM to determine the area of focus of the CNN for deciding whether class 1 is exhibited. The focus ends up being on the empty bottom right square (because certainly you can't exhibit class 1 if the bottom right square is occupied). The CNN also needs to condition its decision on other parts of the board -- it needs to know whether there will be 3 in a row from some direction. But maybe that conditioning is weaker?

That's kind of interesting but I'm not sure about the deeper statements about discovering game rules that the paper hints at. I'm also not sure about the connection of this work to weakly supervised learning or multi-modal learning.

The paper is pretty well written, overall, with some grammatical mistakes, but I simply don't see the surprising discovery of this work. 

I also have some concerns about how contrived this scenario is -- using a big, expressive CNN for such a simple game domain and using a particular CNN visualization method.

795,False,Here's My Point: Argumentation Mining with Pointer Networks,"This paper proposes a model for the task of argumentation mining (labeling the set of relationships between statements expressed as sentence-sized spans in a short text). The model combines a pointer network component that identifies links between statements and a classifier that predicts the roles of these statements. The resulting model works well: It outperforms strong baselines, even on datasets with fewer than 100 training examples.

I don't see any major technical issues with this paper, and the results are strong. I am concerned, though, that the paper doesn't make a substantial novel contribution to representation learning. It focuses on ways to adapt reasonably mature techniques to a novel NLP problem. I think that one of the ACL conferences would be a better fit for this work.

The choice of a pointer network for this problem seems reasonable, though (as noted by other commenters) the paper does not make any substantial comparison with other possible ways of producing trees. The paper does a solid job at breaking down the results quantitatively, but I would appreciate some examples of model output and some qualitative error analysis.

796,False,Here's My Point: Argumentation Mining with Pointer Networks,"This paper addresses the problem of argument mining, which consists of finding argument types and predicting the relationships between the arguments. The authors proposed a pointer network structure to recover the argument relations. They also propose modifications on pointer network to perform joint training on both type and link prediction tasks. Overall the model is reasonable, but I am not sure if ICLR is the best venue for this work.

My first concern of the paper is on the novelty of the model. Pointer network has been proposed before. The proposed multi-task learning method is interesting, but the authors only verified it on one task. This makes me feel that maybe the submission is more for a NLP conference rather than ICLR. 

The authors stated that the pointer network is less restrictive compared to some of the existing tree predicting method. However, the datasets seem to only contain single trees or forests, and the stack-based method can be used for forest prediction by adding a virtual root node to each example (as done in the dependency parsing tasks). Therefore, I think the experiments right now cannot reflect the advantages of pointer network models unfortunately. 

My second concern of the paper is on the target task. Given that the authors want to analyze the structures between sentences, is the argumentation mining the best dataset? For example, authors could verify their model by applying it to the other tasks that require tree structures such as dependency parsing. As for NLP applications, I found that the assumption that the boundaries of AC are given is a very strong constraint, and could potentially limit the usefulness of the proposed model. 

Overall, in terms of ML, I also feel that baseline methods the authors compared to are probably strong for the argument mining task, but not necessary strong enough for the general tree/forest prediction tasks (as there are other tree/forest prediction methods). In terms of NLP applications, I think the assumption of having AC boundaries is too restrictive, and maybe ICLR is not the best venture for this submission.

797,True,Sparsely-Connected Neural Networks: Towards Efficient VLSI Implementation of Deep Neural Networks,"From my original comments:

The results looks good but the baselines proposed are quite bad.

For instance in the table 2 ""Misclassification rate for a 784-1024-1024-1024-10 "" the result for the FC with floating point is 1.33%. Well far from what we can obtain from this topology, near to 0.8%. I would like to see ""significant"" compression levels on state of the art results or good baselines. I can get 0,6% with two FC hidden layers...

In CIFAR-10 experiments, i do not understand  why ""Sparsely-Connected 90% + Single-Precision Floating-Point"" is worse than ""Sparsely-Connected 90% + BinaryConnect"". So it is better to use binary than float. 

Again i think that in the experiments the authors are not using all the techniques that can be easily applied to float but not to binary (gaussian noise or other regularizations). Therefore under my point of view the comparison between float and binary is not fair. This is a critic also for the original papers about binary and ternary precision. 

In fact with this convolutional network, floating (standard) precision we can get lower that 9% of error rate. Again bad baselines.

798,True,Sparsely-Connected Neural Networks: Towards Efficient VLSI Implementation of Deep Neural Networks,"The paper proposes a sparsely connected network and an efficient hardware architecture that can save up to 90% of memory compared to the conventional implementations of fully connected neural networks. 
The paper removes some of the connections in the fully connected layers and shows performance and computational efficiency increase in networks on three different datasets. It is also a good addition that the authors combine their method with binary and ternary connect studies and show further improvements.
The paper was hard for me to understand because of this misleading statement: In this paper, we propose sparsely-connected networks by reducing the number of connections of fully-connected networks using linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs). It led me to think that LFSRs reduced the connections by keeping some of the information in the registers. However, LFSR is only used as a random binary generator. Any random generator could be used but LFSR is chosen for the convenience in VLSI implementation. 
This explanation would be clearer to me: In this paper, we propose sparsely-connected networks by randomly removing some of the connections in fully-connected networks. Random connection masks are generated by LFSR, which is also used in the VLSI implementation to disable the connections.
Algorithm 1 is basically training a network with back-propogation where each layer has a binary mask that disables some of the connections. This explanation can be added to the text.

799,True,Towards the Limit of Network Quantization,"This paper proposes a network quantization method for compressing the parameters of neural networks, therefore, compressing the amount of storage needed for the parameters.  The authors assume that the network is already pruned and aim for compressing the non-pruned parameters. The problem of network compression is a well-motivated problem and of interest to the ICLR community. 

The main drawback of the paper is its novelty. The paper is heavily built on the results of Han 2015 and only marginally extends Han 2015 to overcome its drawbacks. It should be noted that the proposed method in this paper has not been proposed before. 

The paper is well-structured and easy to follow. Although it heavily builds on Han 2015, it is still much longer than Han 2015. I believe that there is still some redundancy in the paper. The experiments section starts on Page 12 whereas for Han 2015 the experiments start on page 5. Therefore, I believe much of the introductory text is redundant and can be efficiently cut. 

Experimental results in the paper show good compression performance compared to Han 2015 while losing very little accuracy. Can the authors mention why there is no comparison with Hang 2015 on ResNet in Table 1?

1) It is not clear whether the procedure depicted in figure 1 is the authors’ contribution or has been in the literature.

800,True,Towards the Limit of Network Quantization,"This paper proposes a novel neural network compression technique.
The goal is to compress maximally the network specification via parameter quantisation with a minimum impact on the expected loss.
It assumes pruning of the network parameters has already been performed, and only considers the quantisation of the individual scalar parameters of the network.
In contrast to previous work (Han et al. 2015a, Gong et al. 2014) the proposed approach takes into account the effect of the weight quantisation on the loss function that is used to train the network, and also takes into account the effect on a variable-length binary encoding of the cluster centers used for the quantisation. 

Unfortunately, the submitted paper is 20 pages, rather than the 8 recommended. The length of the paper seems unjustified to me, since the first three sections (first five pages) are very generic and redundant can be largely compressed or skipped (including figures 1 and 2). Although not a strict requirement by the submission guidelines, I would suggest the authors to compress their paper to 8 pages, this will improve the readability of the paper.

To take into account the impact on the network’s loss the authors propose to use a second order approximation of the cost function of the loss. In the case of weights that originally constitute a local minimum of the loss, this leads to a formulation of the impact of the weight quantization on the loss in terms of a weighted k-means clustering objective, where the weights are derived from the hessian of the loss function at the original weights.
The hessian can be computed efficiently using a back-propagation algorithm similar to that used to compute the gradient, as shown in cited work from the literature. 
The authors also propose to alternatively use a second-order moment term used by the Adam optimisation algorithm, since it can be loosely interpreted as an approximate Hessian. 

In section 4.5 the authors argue that with their approach it is more natural to quantise weights across all layers together, due to the hessian weighting which takes into account the variable impact across layers of quantisation errors on the network performance. 
The last statement in this section, however, was not clear to me: 
“In such deep neural networks, quantising network parameters of all layers together is more efficient since optimizing layer-by-layer clustering jointly across all layers requires exponential time complexity with respect to the number of layers.”
Perhaps the authors could elaborate a bit more on this point?

In section 5 the authors develop methods to take into account the code length of the weight quantisation in the clustering process. 
The first method described by the authors (based on previous work), is uniform quantisation of the weight space, which is then further optimised by their hessian-weighted clustering procedure from section 4. 
For the case of nonuniform codeword lengths to encode the cluster indices, the authors develop a modification of the Hessian weighted k-means algorithm in which the code length of each cluster is also taken into account, weighted by a factor lambda. Different values of lambda give rise to different compression-accuracy trade-offs, and the authors propose to cluster weights for a variety of lambda values and then pick the most accurate solution obtained, given a certain compression budget.  

In section 6 the authors report a number of experimental results that were obtained with the proposed methods, and compare these results to those obtained by the layer-wise compression technique of Han et al 2015, and to the uncompressed models. 
For these experiments the authors used three datasets, MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet, with data-set specific architectures taken from the literature. 
These results suggest a consistent and significant advantage of the proposed method over the work of Han et al. Comparison to the work of Gong et al 2014 is not made.
The results illustrate the advantage of the hessian weighted k-means clustering criterion, and the advantages of the variable bitrate cluster encoding.  

In conclusion I would say that this is quite interesting work, although the technical novelty seems limited (but I’m not a quantisation expert).
Interestingly, the proposed techniques do not seem specific to deep conv nets, but rather generically applicable to quantisation of parameters of any model with an associated cost function for which a locally quadratic approximation can be formulated. It would be useful if the authors would discuss this point in their paper.

801,True,Towards the Limit of Network Quantization,"The paper has two main contributions:

1) Shows that uniform quantization works well with variable length (Huffman) coding

2) Improves fixed-length quantization by proposing the Hessian-weighted k-means, as opposed to standardly used vanilla k-means. The Hessian weighting is well motivated, and it is also explained how to use an efficient approximation ""for free"" when using the Adam optimizer, which is quite neat. As opposed to vanilla k-means, one of the main benefits of this approach (apart from improved performance) is that no tuning on per-layer compression rates is required, as this is achieved for free.

To conclude, I like the paper: (1) is not really novel but it doesn't seem other papers have done this before so it's nice to know it works well, and (2) is quite neat and also works well. The paper is easy to follow, results are good. My only complaint is that it's a bit too long.

Minor note - I still don't understand the parts about storing ""additional bits for each binary codeword for layer indication"" when doing layer-by-layer quantization. What's the problem of just having an array of quantized weight values for each layer, i.e. q[0][:] would store all quantized weights for layer 0, q[1][:] for layer 1 etc, and for each layer you would have the codebook. So the only overhead over joint quantization is storing the codebook for each layer, which is insignificant. I don't understand the ""additional bit"" part. But anyway, this is really not a important as I don't think it affects the paper at all, just authors might want to additionally clarify this point (maybe I'm missing something obvious, but if I am then it's likely some other people will as well).

As indicated in my preliminary question, the authors do not make the case about why any of the techniques they propose is beyond what we know already: factorizing filters into alternating 1-D convolutions, using low-rank kernels, or any of the newer inception network architectures.

I have had a hard time figuring out what is the take-home message of this paper. All of these ideas are known, and have proven their worth for detection. If a paper is going to be accepted for applying them to semantic segmentation, then in the next conference another paper should be accepted for applying them to normal estimation, another to saliency estimation and so on. 

As the authors mention in their preliminary review:
""I agree that most improvements from classification architectures are straightforward to apply to object segmentation, and that's exactly what we've done - our network is based on current state of the art models. Instead of repeating most of the discussion on factorizing filters, etc., that has been discussed in a lot of papers already, we have decided that it's much more valuable to describe in depth the choices that are related to segmentation only - these are the most important contributions of our paper.""

I do not see however any in-depth discussion of certain choices - e.g. an analysis of how certain choices influence performance or speed. Instead all one gets are some statements ""these gave a significant accuracy boost"" ""this helped a lot"", ""that did not help"", ""this turned out to work much better than that"" . This is not informative - and is more like an informal chat rather than an in-depth discussion.

Review summary: Albeit the results seem interesting, the paper lacks detailed experimental results, and is of limited interest for the ICLR audience.


Pros:
* 10x faster
* 10x smaller
* Design rationale described in detail


Cons:
* The quality of the reference baseline is low. For instance, cityscapes results are 58.3 IoU while state of the art is ~80 IoU. Thus the results are of limited interest.
* The results that support the design rationale are not provided. It is important to provide the experimental evidence to support each claim.


Quality: the work is interesting but feels incomplete. If your model is 10x faster and smaller, why not try build a model 10x longer to obtain improved results ? The paper focuses only on  nimbleness at the cost of quality (using a weak baseline). This limits the interest for the ICLR audience.


Clarity: the overall text is somewhat clear, but the model description (section 3) could be more clear. 


Originality: the work is a compendium of “practitioners wisdom” applied to a specific task. It has thus limited originality.


Significance: I find the work that establishes a new “best practices all in one” quite interesting, but however these must shine in all aspects. Being fast at the cost of quality, will limit the impact of this work.

* Overall the text is proper english but the sentences constructions is often unsound, specific examples below. 
* To improve the chances of acceptance, I invite the authors to also explore bigger models and show that the same “collected wisdom” can be used both to reach high speed and high quality (with the proper trade-off curve being shown). Aiming for only one end of the quality versus speed curve limits too much the paper.

However, this section lacks measurements and experimental results showing the effects of these choices.  To me, that would have been a key component to the paper.

809,False,Inefficiency of stochastic gradient descent with larger mini-batches (and more learners),"This paper shows that when a larger mini-batch is used (in the serial setting), the number of samples needed to be processed for the same convergence guarantee is larger. A similar behavior is discussed for using multiple learners in asynchronous SGD. This behavior has been known in convex optimization (e.g., ""Better Mini-Batch Algorithms via Accelerated Gradient Methods"", NIPS 2011). There, the convergence is of the form O(1/\sqrt{bT}+1/T), and so using bT samples only lead to \sqrt{b} time improvement. This paper extends a similar result to the nonconvex case (but the underlying mathematics is mainly from [Ghadimi & Lan, 2013]). However, this behavior is also known and indeed has been summarized in the deep learning textbook (chapter 8). Hence, the novelty is limited.

The theoretical results in this paper suggest that it is best not to use mini-batch. However, using mini-batch is often beneficial in practice. As discussed in the deep learning textbook, using mini-batch allows using a larger learning rate (note that this paper assumes the same learning rate for both mini-batch sizes). Moreover, multicore architectures allows parallel execution of mini-batch almost for free. Hence, the practical significance of the results is also limited.

However, the same K is used on the LHS of (4).

810,False,Inference and Introspection in Deep Generative Models of Sparse Data,"The paper claims improved inference for density estimation of sparse data (here text documents) using deep generative Gaussian models (variational auto-encoders), and a method for deriving word embeddings from the model's generative parameters that allows for a degree of interpretability similar to that of Bayesian generative topic models.

To discuss the contributions I will quickly review the generative story in the paper: first a K-dimensional latent representation is sampled from a multivariate Gaussian, then an MLP (with parameters \theta) predicts unnormalised potentials over a vocabulary of V words, the potentials are exponentiated and normalised to make the parameters of a multinomial from where word observations are repeatedly sampled to make a document. Here intractable inference is replaced by the VAE formulation where an inference network (with parameters \phi) independently predicts for each document the mean and variance of a normal distribution (amenable to reparameterised gradient computation).

The first, and rather trivial, contribution is to use tf-idf features to inject first order statistics (a global information) into local observations. The authors claim that this is particularly helpful in the case of sparse data such as text.

The second contribution is more interesting. In optimising generative parameters (\theta) and variational parameters (\phi), the authors turn to a treatment which is reminiscent of the original SVI procedure. That is, they see the variational parameters \phi as *global* variational parameters, and the predicted mean \mu(x) and covariance \Sigma(x) of each observation x are treated as *local* variational parameters. In the original VAE, local parameters are not directly optimised, instead they are indirectly optimised via optimisation of the global parameters utilised in their prediction (shared MLP parameters). Here, local parameters are optimised holding generative parameters fixed (line 3 of Algorithm 1). The optimised local parameters are then used in the gradient step of the generative parameters (line 4 of Algorithm 1). Finally, global variational parameters are also updated (line 5). 
Whereas indeed other authors have proposed to optimise local parameters, I think that deriving this procedure from the more familiar SVI makes the contribution less of a trick and easier to relate to.

Some things aren't entirely clear to me. I think it would have been nice if the authors had shown the functional form of the gradient used in step 3 of Algorithm 1. The gradient step for global variational parameters (line 5 of Algorithm 1) uses the very first prediction of local parameters (thus ignoring the optimisation in step 3), this is unclear to me. Perhaps I am missing a fundamental reason why that has to be the case (either way, please clarify).
The authors argue that this optimisation turns out helpful to modelling sparse data because there is evidence that the generative model p_\theta(x|z) suffers from poor initialisation. Please, discuss why you expect the initialisation problem to be worse in the case of sparse data.

The final contribution is a neat procedure to derive word embeddings from the generative model parameters. These embeddings are then used to interpret what the model has learnt. Interestingly, these word embeddings are context-sensitive once that the latent variable models an entire document.

About Figures 2a and 2b: the caption says that solid lines indicate validation perplexity for M=1 (no optimisation of local parameters) and dashed lines indicate M=100 (100 iterations of optimisation of local parameters), but the legends of the figures suggest a different reading. If I interpret the figures based on the caption, then it seems that indeed deeper networks exposed to more data benefit from optimisation of local parameters. Are the authors pretty sure that in Figure 2b models with M=1 have reached a plateau (so that longer training would not allow them to catch up with M=100 curves)? As the authors explain in the caption, x-axis is not comparable on running time, thus the question.

The analysis of singular values seems like an interesting way to investigate how the model is using its capacity.  However, I can barely interpret Figures 2c and 2d, I think the authors could have walked readers through them.

As for the word embedding I am missing an evaluation on a predictive task. Also, while illustrative, Table 2b is barely reproducible. The text reads ""we create a document comprising a subset of words in the the context’s Wikipedia page."" which is rather vague. I wonder whether this construct needs to be carefully designed in order to get Table 2b.

In sum, I have a feeling that the inference technique and the embedding technique are both useful, but perhaps they should have been presented separately so that each could have been explored in greater depth.",,6.0,4.0

Summary : In this paper a variational inference is adapted to deep generative models, showing improvement for non-negative sparse dataset. The authors offer as well a method to interpret the data through the model parameters.

The writing is generally clear. The methods seem correct. The introspection approach appears to be original. I found very interesting the experiment on the polysemic word embedding. I would however have like to see how the obtained embedding would perform with respect to other more common embeddings in solving a supervised task.

1) tf-idf weighting
2) Iteratively optimizing variational parameters after initializing them with an inference network
3) A technique for improving the interpretability of the deep model

The first idea is sensible but rather trivial as a contribution. The second idea is also sensible, but is conceptually not novel. What is new is the finding that it works well for the dataset used in this paper.

The third idea is interesting, and seems to give qualitatively reasonable results. The quantitative semantic similarity results don’t seem that convincing, but I am not very familiar with the relevant literature and therefore cannot make a confident judgement on this issue.",,5.0,3.0
813,False,Inference and Introspection in Deep Generative Models of Sparse Data,"This paper presents a small trick to improve the model quality of variational autoencoders (further optimizing the ELBO while initializing it from the predictions of the q network, instead of just using those directly) and the idea of using Jacobian vectors to replace simple embeddings when interpreting variational autoencoders.

The idea of the Jacobian as a natural replacement for embeddings is interesting, as it does seem to cleanly generalize the notion of embeddings from linear models. It'd be interesting to see comparisons with other work seeking to provide context-specific embeddings, either by clustering or by smarter techniques (like Neelakantan et al, Efficient non-parametric estimation of multiple embeddings per word in vector space, or Chen et al A Unified Model for Word Sense Representation and Disambiguation). With the evidence provided in the experimental section of the paper it's hard to be convinced that the Jacobian of VAE-generated embeddings is substantially better at being context-sensitive than prior work.

Similarly, the idea of further optimizing the ELBO is interesting but not fully explored. It's unclear, for example, what is the tradeoff between the complexity of the q network and steps further optimizing the ELBO, in terms of compute versus accuracy.

Overall the ideas in this paper are good but I'd like to see them a little more fleshed out.",,5.0,4.0
814,False,Inference and Introspection in Deep Generative Models of Sparse Data,"[R1] Yes. Though our point was to highlight that instead of just conditioning on the input directly, thinking about how to incorporate other characteristics of the data the inference network typically has no access to (such as global first order statistics, which in the case of non-negative data corresponds to tf-idf features) helps learning.  We have updated the algorithm box to make clear the role of the additional optimization of the local variational parameters in the revised version. 

[R4] The current implementation is about 15x slower (we have emphasized this in the caption for Fig. 2) since we do 100 steps of optimizing the variational parameter. It is possible that this additional optimization is primarily helpful in the first few epochs after which one could resume training normally, though we did not experiment with such variants.

815,False,Marginal Deep Architectures: Deep learning for Small and Middle Scale Applications,"This paper proposes to initialize the weights of a deep neural network layer-wise with a marginal Fisher analysis model, making use of potentially the similarity metric.
 
Pros: 
There are a lot of experiments, albeit small datasets, that the authors tested their proposed method on.

Cons:
lacking baseline such as discriminatively trained convolutional network on standard dataset such as CIFAR-10.
It is also unclear how costly in computation to compute the association matrix A in equation 4.

This is an OK paper, where a new idea is proposed, and combined with other existing ideas such as greedy-layerwise stacking, dropout, and denoising auto-encoders.
However, there have been many papers with similar ideas perhaps 3-5 years ago, e.g. SPCANet. 

Therefore, the main novelty is the use of marginal Fisher Analysis as a new layer. This would be ok, but the baselines to demonstrate that this approach works better is missing. In particular, I'd like to see a conv net or fully connected net trained from scratch with good initialization would do at these problems.

To improve the paper, the authors should try to demonstrate without doubt that initializing layers with MFA is better than just random weight matrices.",,4.0,4.0
816,False,Marginal Deep Architectures: Deep learning for Small and Middle Scale Applications,"The proposed approach consists in a greedy layer wise initialization strategy for a deep MLP model, which is followed by global gradient-descent with dropout for fine-tuning. The initialization strategy uses a first randomly initialized sigmoid layer for dimensionality expansion followed by 2 sigmoid layers whose weights are initialized by Marginal Fisher Analysis (MFA) which learns a linear dimensionality reduction based on a neighborhood graph constructed using class label information (i.e. supervised dimensionality reduction). Output layer is a standard softmax layer.

The approach is thus to be added to a growing list of heuristic layer-wise initialization schemes.
The particular choice of initialization strategy, while reasonable, is not sufficiently well motivated in the paper relative to alternatives, and thus feels rather arbitrary.
The paper lacks clarity in the description of the approach:  MFA is poorly explained with undefined notations (in Eq. 4, what is A? It has not been properly defined); the precise use of alluded denoising in the model is also unclear (is there really training of an additional denoting objective, or just input corruption?).

The question of the (arguably mild) inconsistency of applying a linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, that is trained without any sigmoid, and then passing its learned representation through a sigmoid is not even raised. This, in addition to the fact that sigmoid hidden layers are no longer commonly used (why did you not also consider using RELUs?).

More importantly I suspect methodological problems with the experimental comparisons: the paper mentions using *default* values for learning-rate and momentum, and having (arbitrarily?) fixed epoch to 400 (no early stopping?) and L2 regularization to 1e-4 for some models. 
*All* hyper parameters should always be properly hyper-optimized using a validation set (or cross-validation) including early-stopping, and this separately for each model under comparison (ideally also including layer sizes). This is all the more important since you are considering smallish datasets, so that the various initialization strategies act mainly as different indirect regularization schemes: they thus need to be carefully tuned. This casts serious doubts as to the amount of hyper-parameter tuning (close to none?) that went into training the alternative models used for comparison. 

The Marginal Fisher Analysis dimensionality reduction initialization strategy may well offer advantages, but as it currently stands this paper doesn’t yet make a sufficiently convincing case for it, nor provide useful insights into the nature of the expected advantages.

I would also suggest, for image inputs such as CIFAR10, to use the qualitative tool of showing the filters (back projected to input space) learned by the different initialization schemes under consideration, as this could help visually gain insight as to what sets methods apart.

817,False,Marginal Deep Architectures: Deep learning for Small and Middle Scale Applications,"The authors pointed out some limitations of existing deep architectures, in particular hard to optimize on small or mid size datasets, and proposed to stack marginal fisher analysis (MFA) to build deep models. The proposed method is tested on several small to mid size datasets and compared with several feature learning methods. The authors also applied some existing techniques in deep learning, such as backprop, denoising and dropout to improve performance. 

The new contribution of the paper is limited. MFA has long been proposed. The authors fail to theoretically or empirically justify the stacking of MFAs. The authors did not include any deep architectures that requires backprop over multiple layers in the comparison, which the authors set out to address, instead all the methods compared were learned layer by layer. Will a randomly initialized deep model such as DBN or CNN perform poorly on these datasets? It is also not clear how the authors came up with each particular model architecture and hyper-parameters used in the different datasets. The writing of the paper needs to be significantly improved. A lot of details were omitted, for example, how is dropout applied in the MFA. ",,4.0,4.0
818,False,Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis,"The proposed method is simple and elegant; it builds upon the huge success of gradient based optimization for deep non-linear function approximators and combines it with established (linear) many-view CCA methods. A major contribution of this paper is the derivation of the gradients with respect to the non-linear encoding networks which project the different views into a common space. The derivation seems correct. In general this approach seems very interesting and I could imagine that it might be applicable to many other similarly structured problems.
The paper is well written; but it could be enhanced with an explicit description of the complete algorithm which also highlights how the joint embeddings G and U are updated. 
 
I don’t have prior experience with CCA-style many-view techniques and it is therefore hard for me to judge the practical/empirical progress presented here. But the experiments seem reasonable convincing; although generally only performed on small and medium sized datasets.
  
Detailed comments: 

The colours or the sign of the x-axis in figure 3b seem to be flipped compared to figure 4.
  
It would be nice to additionally see a continuous (rainbow-coloured) version for Figures 2, 3 and 4 to better identify neighbouring datapoints; but more importantly: I’d like to see how the average reconstruction error between the individual network outputs and the learned representation develop during training.  Is the mismatch between different views on a validation/test-set a useful metric for cross validation? In general, it seems the method is sensitive to regularization and hyperparameter selection  (because it has many more parameters compared to GCCA and different regularization parameters have been chosen for different views) and I wonder if there is a clear metric to optimize these.",,7.0,3.0

Even if the method is mostly a extension of classical tools (the scheme learns a (deep) network for each view essentially), the combination of the different sources of information seems to be effective for the studied datasets. 

It would be interesting to add or discuss the following issues:

- what is the complexity of the proposed method, esp. the representation learning part?
- would there by any alternative solution to combine the different networks/views? That could make the proposed solution more novel.
- the experimental settings, especially in the synthetic experiments, should be more detailed. If possible, the datasets should be made available to encourage reproducibility.

Kumar, X. Dong, Ping-Yu Chen, M. Bronstein, and many others have proposed works in that direction in the last 5 years).

820,False,Deep Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis,"This paper proposes a deep extension of generalized CCA. The main contribution of the paper is deriving the gradient update for the GCCA objective.

I disagree with the claim that “this is the first Multiview representation learning technique that combines the flexibility of nonlinear representation learning with the statistical power of incorporating information from many independent resources or views”.  [R1] proposes a Multiview representation learning method which is both non-linear and capable of handling more than 2 views. This is very much relevant to what authors are proposing. The objective function proposed in [R1] maximizes the correlation between views and minimizes the self and cross reconstruction errors. This is intuitively similar to nonlinear version of PCA+CCA for multiple views. Comparing these 2 methods is crucial to prove the usefulness of DGCCA and the paper is incomplete without this comparison. Authors should also change their strong claim.

Related work section is minimal. There are significant advances in 2-view non-linear representation learning which are worth mentioning.

821,False,Out-of-class novelty generation: an experimental foundation,"This paper proposed a quantitative metric for evaluating out-of-class novelty of samples from generative models. The authors evaluated the proposed metric on over 1000 models with different hyperparameters and performed human subject study on a subset of them.

The authors mentioned difficulties in human subject studies, but did not provide details of their own setting. An ""in-house"" annotation tool was used but it's unclear how many subjects were involved, who they are, and how many samples were presented to each subject. I'm worried about the diversity in the subjects because there may be too few subjects who are shown too many samples and/or are experts in this field.

This paper aims at proposing a general metric for novelty but the experiments only used one setting, namely generating Arabic digits and English letters. There is insufficient evidence to prove the generality of the proposed metric.

Moreover, defining English letters as ""novel"" compared to Arabic digits is questionable. What if the model generates Arabic or Indian letters? Can a human who has never seen Arabic handwriting tell it from random doodle? What makes English letters more ""novel"" than random doodle? In my opinion these questions are best answered through large scale human subject study on tasks that has clear real world meanings. For example, do you prefer painting A (generated) or B (painted by artist).",,5.0,3.0
822,False,Out-of-class novelty generation: an experimental foundation,"This paper examines computational creativity from a machine learning perspective. Creativity is defined as a model's ability to generate new types of objects unseen during training. The authors argue that likelihood training and evaluation are by construction ill-suited for out-of-class generation and propose a new evaluation framework which relies on the use of held-out classes of objects to measure a model's ability to generate new and interesting object types.

I am not very familiar with the literature on computational creativity research, so I can't judge on how well this work has been put into the context of existing work. From a machine learning perspective, I find the ideas presented in this paper new, interesting and thought-provoking.

As I understand, the hypothesis is that the ability of a model to generate new and interesting types we *do not* know about correlates with its ability to generate new and interesting types we *do* know about, and the latter is a good proxy for the former. The extent to which this is true depends on the bias introduced by model selection. Just like when measuring generalization performance, one should be careful not to reuse the same held-out classes for model selection and for evaluation.

Nevertheless, I appreciate the effort that has been made to formalize the notion of computational creativity within the machine learning framework. I view it as an important first step in that direction, and I think it deserves its place at ICLR, especially given that the paper is well-written and approachable for machine learning researchers.",,7.0,4.0

Some empirical experiments were reported. 
The novelty is hard to define. The proposed metric is also problematic. A naive combination of MNIST and letters dataset do not represent the natural distribution of handwritten digits and letters. IT means that the model trained on the combination could not properly distinguished digits and letters. The proposed out-of-class count and out-of-class max are thus pointless. For the ""novel"" samples in Fig. 3,  they are clearly digits. I guess they quantize the samples to binary.

824,True,Learning End-to-End Goal-Oriented Dialog,"Attempts to use chatbots for every form of human-computer interaction has been a major trend in 2016, with claims that they could solve many forms of dialogs beyond simple chit-chat. This paper represents a serious reality check. While it is mostly relevant for Dialog/Natural Language venues (to educate software engineer about the limitations of current chatbots), it can also be published at Machine Learning venues (to educate researchers about the need for more realistic validation of ML applied to dialogs), so I would consider this work of  high significance.

Two important conjectures are underlying this paper and likely to open to more research. While they are not in writing, Antoine Bordes clearly stated them during a NIPS workshop presentation that covered this work. Considering the metrics chosen in this paper:
1)	The performance of end2end ML approaches is still insufficient for goal oriented dialogs.
2)	When comparing algorithms, relative performance on synthetic data is a good predictor of performance on natural data. This would be quite a departure from previous observations, but the authors made a strong effort to match the synthetic and natural conditions.

While its original algorithmic contribution consists in one rather simple addition to memory networks (match type), it is the first time these are deployed and tested on a goal-oriented dialog, and the experimental protocol is excellent. The overall paper clarity is excellent and accessible to a readership beyond ML and dialog researchers. I was in particular impressed by how the short appendix on memory networks summarized them so well, followed by the tables that explained the influence of the number of hops.

While this paper represents the state-of-the-art in the exploration of more rigorous metrics for dialog modeling, it also reminds us how brittle and somewhat arbitrary these remain. Note this is more a recommendation for future research than  for revision.

First they use the per-response accuracy (basically the next utterance classification among a fixed list of responses). Looking at table 3 clearly shows how absurd this can be in practice: all that matters is a correct API call and a reasonably short dialog, though this would only give us a 1/7 accuracy, as the 6 bot responses needed to reach the API call also have to be exact.

Would the per-dialog accuracy, where all responses must be correct, be better? Table 2 shows how sensitive it is to the experimental protocol. I was initially puzzled that the accuracy for subtask T3 (0.0) was much lower that the accuracy for the full dialog T5 (19.7), until the authors pointed me to the tasks definitions (3.1.1) where T3 requires displaying 3 options while T5 only requires displaying one.

For the concierge data, what would happen if ‘correct’ meant being the best, not among the 5-best? 

While I cannot fault the authors for using standard dialog metrics, and coming up with new ones that are actually too pessimistic, I can think of one way to represent dialogs that could result in more meaningful metrics in goal oriented dialogs. Suppose I sell Virtual Assistants as a service, being paid upon successful completion of a dialog. What is the metric that would maximize my revenue? In this restaurant problem, the loss would probably be some weighted sum of the number of errors in the API call, the number of turns to reach that API call and the number of rejected options by the user. However, such as loss cannot be measured on canned dialogs and would either require a real human user or an realistic simulator

Another issue closely related to representation learning that this paper fails to address or explain properly is what happens if the vocabulary used by the user does not match exactly the vocabulary in the knowledge base. In particular, for the match type algorithm to code ‘Indian’ as ‘type of cuisine’, this word would have to occur exactly in the KB. I can imagine situations where the KB uses some obfuscated terminology, and we would like ML to learn the associations rather than humans to hand-describe them.

825,True,Learning End-to-End Goal-Oriented Dialog,"SYNOPSIS:
This paper introduces a new dataset for evaluating end-to-end goal-oriented dialog systems.  All data is generated in the restaurant setting, where the goal is to find availability and eventually book a table based on parameters provided by the user to the bot as part of a dialog.  Data is generated by running a simulation using an underlying knowledge base to generate samples for the different parameters (cuisine, price range, etc), and then applying rule-based transformations to render natural language descriptions. The objective is to rank a set of candidate responses for each next turn of the dialog, and evaluation is reported in terms of per-response accuracy and per-dialog accuracy. The authors show that Memory Networks are able to improve over basic bag-of-words baselines.

THOUGHTS:
I want to thank the authors for an interesting contribution.  Having said that, I am skeptical about the utility of end-to-end trained systems in the narrow-domain setting. In the open-domain setting, there is a strong argument to be made that hand-coding all states and responses would not scale, and hence end-to-end trained methods make a lot of sense. However, in the narrow-domain setting, we usually know and understand the domain quite well, and the goal is to obtain high user satisfaction. Doesn't it then make sense in these cases to use the domain knowledge to engineer the best system possible?

Given that the domain is already restricted, I'm also a bit disappointed that the goal is to RANK instead of GENERATE responses, although I understand that this makes evaluation much easier. I'm also unsure how these candidate responses would actually be obtained in practice? It seems that the models rank the set of all responses in train/val/test (last sentence before Sec 3.2). Since a key argument for the end-to-end training approach is ease of scaling to new domains without having to manually re-engineer the system, where is this information obtained for a new domain in practice?  Generating responses would allow much better generalization to new domains, as opposed to simply ranking some list of hand-collected generic responses, and in my mind this is the weakest part of this work.

Finally, as data is generated using a simulation by expanding (cuisine, price, ...) tuples using NL-generation rules, it necessarily constrains the variability in the training responses. Of course, this is traded off with the ability to generate unlimited data using the simulator. But I was unable to see the list of rules that was used. It would be good to publish this as well.

Overall, despite my skepticism, I think it is an interesting contribution worthy of publication at the conference.

826,True,Learning End-to-End Goal-Oriented Dialog,"This paper presents a new, public dataset and tasks for goal-oriented dialogue applications. The dataset and tasks are constructed artificially using rule-based programs, in such a way that different aspects of dialogue system performance can be evaluated ranging from issuing API calls to displaying options, as well as full-fledged dialogue.

This is a welcome contribution to the dialogue literature, which will help facilitate future research into developing and understanding dialogue systems. Still, there are pitfalls in taking this approach. First, it is not clear how suitable Deep Learning models are for these tasks compared to traditional methods (rule-based systems or shallow models), since Deep Learning models are known to require many training examples and therefore performance difference between different neural networks may simply boil down to regularization techniques. The tasks 1-5 are also completely deterministic, which means evaluating performance on these tasks won't measure the ability of the models to handle noisy and ambiguous interactions (e.g. inferring a distribution over user goals, or executing dialogue repair strategies), which is a very important aspect in dialogue applications. Overall, I still believe this is an interesting direction to explore.

As discussed in the comments below, the paper does not have any baseline model with word order information. I think this is a strong weakness of the paper, because it makes the neural networks appear unreasonably strong, yet simpler baselines could very likely be be competitive (or better) than the proposed neural networks. To maintain a fair evaluation and correctly assess the power of representation learning for this task, I think it's important that the authors experiment with one additional non-neural network benchmark model which takes into account word order information. This would more convincly demonstrate the utility of Deep Learning models for this task. For example, the one could experiment with a logistic regression model which takes as input 1) word embeddings (similar to the Supervised Embeddings model), 2) bi-gram features, and 3) match-type features. If such a baseline is included, I will increase my rating to 8.



Final minor comment: in the conclusion, the paper states ""the existing work has no well defined measures of performances"". This is not really true. End-to-end trainable models for task-oriented dialogue have well-defined performance measures. See, for example ""A Network-based End-to-End Trainable Task-oriented Dialogue System"" by Wen et al. On the other hand, non-goal-oriented dialogue are generally harder to evaluate, but given human subjects these can also be evaluated. In fact, this is what Liu et al (2016) do for Twitter. See also, ""Strategy and Policy Learning for Non-Task-Oriented Conversational Systems"" by Yu et al.

827,True,Learning Features of Music From Scratch,"The paper introduces a new dataset called MusicNet (presumably analogous to ImageNet), featuring dense ground truth labels for 30+ hours of classical music, which is provided as raw audio. Such a dataset is extremely valuable for music information retrieval (MIR) research and a dataset of this size has never before been publicly available. It has the potential to dramatically increase the impact of modern machine learning techniques (e.g. deep learning) in this field, whose adoption has previously been hampered by a lack of available datasets that are large enough. The paper is clear and well-written.

The paper also features some ""example"" experiments using the dataset, which I am somewhat less excited about. The authors decided to focus on one single task that is not particularly challenging: identifying pitches in isolated segments of audio. Pitch information is a fairly low-level characteristic of music. Considering that isolated fragments are used as input, this is a relatively simple problem that probably doesn't even require machine learning to solve adequately, e.g. peak picking on a spectral representation could already get you pretty far. It's not clear what value the machine learning component in the proposed approach actually adds, if any. I could be wrong about this as I haven't done the comparison myself, but I think the burden is on the authors to demonstrate that using ML here is actually useful.

I would argue that one of the strenghts of the dataset is the variety of label information it provides, so a much more convincing setup would have been to demonstrate many different prediction tasks for both low-level (e.g. pitch, onsets) and high-level (e.g. composer) characteristics, perhaps with fewer and simpler models -- maybe even sticking to spectrogram input and forgoing raw audio input for the time being, as this comparison seems orthogonal to the introduction of the dataset itself. As it stands, I feel that the fact that the experiments are relatively uninteresting detracts from the main point of the paper, which is to introduce a new public dataset that is truly unique in terms of its scale and scope.

That said, the experiments seem to have been conducted in a rigorous fashion and the evaluation and analysis of the resulting models is properly executed.

Re: Section 4.5, it is rather unsurprising to me that a pitch detector would learn filters that resemble pitches (i.e. sinusoids), although the observation that this requires a relatively large amount of data is interesting. However, it would be more interesting to demonstrate that this is also the case for higher-level tasks. The authors favourably compare the features learnt by their model with prior work on end-to-end learning from raw audio, but neglect that the tasks considered in this work were much more high-level.

Some might also question whether ICLR is the appropriate venue to introduce a new dataset, but personally I think it's a great idea to submit it here, seeing as it will reach the right people. I suppose this is up to the organisers and the program committee, but I thought it important to mention this, because I don't think this paper merits acceptance based on its experimental results alone.",,6.0,4.0
828,True,Learning Features of Music From Scratch,"This paper introduces MusicNet, a new dataset.

This is great for the community.

The description of the validation of the dataset is interesting, and indicates a careful process was followed.

The authors provide just enough basic experiments to show that this dataset is big enough that good low-level features (i.e. expected sinusoidal variations) can indeed be learned in an end-to-end context.

One might argue that in terms of learning representations, the work presented here contributes more in the dataset than in the experiments or techniques used. However, given the challenges of acquiring good datasets, and given the essential role such datasets play for the community in moving research forward and providing baseline reference points, I feel that this contribution carries substantial weight in terms of expected future rewards. (If research groups were making great new datasets available on a regular basis, that would place this in a different context. But so far, that is not the case.)

The paper is a little disorganised and somewhat contradictory in parts. For example, I find the first sentence in section 2 (MusicNet) would better be pushed one paragraph below so that the section be allowed to begin with a survey of the tools available to researchers in music. Also, the description for Table 3 should probably appear somewhere in the Methods section. Last example: the abstract/intro says the purpose is note prediction; later (4th paragraph of intro) there's a claim that the focus is ""learning low-level features of music....""

830,False,MS MARCO: A Human-Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset,"Summary: The paper proposes a large-scale dataset for reading comprehension, with the final goal of releasing 1 million questions and answers. The authors have currently released 100,000 queries and their answers. The dataset differs from existing reading comprehension datasets mainly w.r.t queries being sampled from user queries rather than being generated by crowd-workers and answers being generated by crowd-workers rather than being spans of text from the provided passage. The paper presents some analysis of the dataset such as distribution of answer types. The paper also presents the results of some generative and some cloze-style models on the MS MARCO dataset.

Strengths:

1. The paper provides useful insights about the limitations of the existing reading comprehension datasets – questions asked by crowd-workers have different distribution compared to that of questions asked by actual users of intelligent agents, answers being restricted to span from the reading text rather than requiring reasoning across multiple pieces of text/passages.

2. MS MARCO dataset has novel useful characteristics compared to existing reading comprehension datasets – questions are sampled from user queries, answers are generated by humans.

3. The experimental evaluation of the existing baseline models on the MS MARCO dataset is satisfactory.

Weaknesses/Suggestions:

1. The paper does not report human performance on the dataset. Human performance should be reported to estimate the difficulty of the dataset. The degree of inter-human agreement will also reflect how well the metric (being used to compute inter-human agreement and accuracies of the baseline models) can deal with variance in the sentence structure with similar semantics.

2. I would like to see the comparison between the answer type distribution in the MS MARCO dataset and that in existing reading comprehension datasets such as SQuAD. This would ground the claim made in the paper the distributions of questions asked by crowd-workers is different from that of user queries.

3. The paper uses automatic metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU for evaluating natural language answers. However, it is known that such metrics poorly correlate with human judgement for tasks such as image caption evaluation (Chen et al., Microsoft COCO Captions: Data Collection and Evaluation Server, CoRR abs/1504.00325 (2015)). So, I wonder how authors justify using such metrics for evaluating open-ended natural language answers.

4. The paper mentions that a classifier was used to filter answer seeking queries from all Bing queries. It would be good to mention the accuracy of this classifier. This will provide insights into what percentage of the MS MARCO questions are answer seeking queries. Similarly, what is the accuracy of the information retrieval based system used to retrieve passages for filtered queries?

5. Please include the description of the best passage baseline in the paper.
  
6. Fix opening quotes, i.e. ” -> “ (for instance, on page 5, ”what” -> “what”).

Review Summary: The paper is well motivated, the use of user queries and human generated answers makes the dataset different from existing datasets. However, I would like to see the human performance on the dataset and quantitative comparison between the distribution of questions obtained from user queries and that of crowd-sourced questions. I would also like the authors to comment on the use of automatic metrics (such as ROUGE, BLEU) in the light of the fact that such metrics do not correlate well with human judgements for tasks such as image caption evaluation.",,6.0,3.0

2. What is ""a DSSM-alike passage ranking model""?

832,False,MS MARCO: A Human-Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset,"Paper Summary: 
This paper presents a new large scale machine reading comprehension dataset called MS MARCO. It is different from existing datasets in that the questions are real user queries, the context passages are real web documents, and free form answers are generated by humans instead of spans in the context. The paper also includes some analysis of the dataset and performance of QA models on the dataset.

Paper Strengths: 
-- The questions in the dataset are real queries from users instead of humans writing questions given some context.
-- Context passages are extracted from real web documents which are used by search engines to find answers to the given query.
-- Answers are generated by humans instead of being spans in context.
-- It is large scale dataset, with an aim of 1 million queries. Current release includes 100,000 queries.

Paper Weaknesses: 
-- The authors say, ""We have found that the distribution of actual questions users ask intelligent agents can be very different from those conceived from crowdsourcing them from the text."", but the statement is not backed up with any study.
-- The paper doesn't clearly present what additional information can today's QA models learn from MS MARCO which they can't from existing datasets. 
-- The paper should talk about what challenges are involved in obtaining a good performance on this dataset.
-- What are the human performances as compared to the models presented in the paper?
-- In section 4.1, what are the train/test splits? The results are for the subset of MS MARCO where every query has multiple answers. How big is that subset?
-- What is DSSM mentioned in row 2, Table 5?
-- The authors should include in the paper how experiments in section 4.2 prove that MS MARCO is a better dataset.
-- In Table 6, the performance of Memory Networks is already close to Best Passage. Does that mean there is not enough room for improvement there?
-- The paper seems to be written in hurry, with partial analysis, evaluation and various mistakes in the text.

Preliminary Evaluation: 
The proposed dataset MS MARCO is unique from existing datasets as it is a good representative of the QA task encountered by search engines. I think it can be a very useful dataset for the community to benefit from. Given the huge potential in the dataset, this paper lacks the analysis and evaluation needed to present the dataset's worth. I think it can benefit a lot with a more comprehensive analysis of the dataset.",,6.0,3.0
833,False,MS MARCO: A Human-Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset,"This is a dataset paper that brings unique values over existing reading comprehension challenges. Unlike others, MS MARCO is derived from query logs, thus represents real questions that people ask, rather than solicited questions that might be rather artificial in practical settings.

There are potential downsides of using query logs however. It may be that people adapt their language and questions for search engines such that users ask questions that they know current search engines can reasonably answer. Thus, it may be that people limit the complexity of questions or language or both. I think authors could have addressed this concern by being more selective about the query logs, by down-sampling on simple questions that can be easily answered by keyword matching without any sophisticated reading comprehension, and up-sampling more complex questions that require at least paraphrasing and ideally synthesis of information taken from more than one sentences.

It’s great that there are several new efforts to construct large-scale reading comprehension challenges, but my main concern is whether the majority of the questions can be answered through relatively easy text matching without intelligent reading or reasoning.

Also, the paper reads like the authors were running out of time before the deadline. I would appreciate more analytic and quantitative comparisons against other existing datasets, and more insights on the degree of challenges required to handle QAs in MS MARCO. For example, the authors could collect statistics on QAs: (1) exact match exists in the text snippet, (2) paraphrasing is required but otherwise the relevant answer is directly available in the text snippet, (3) requires synthesizing information taken from more than one sentences, (4) requires external knowledge. The author response mentions that (4) is unlikely, but a more formal and complete analysis would be helpful.

834,True,DSD: Dense-Sparse-Dense Training for Deep Neural Networks,"Training highly non-convex deep neural networks is a very important practical problem, and this paper provides a great exploration of an interesting new idea for more effective training.  The empirical evaluation both in the paper itself and in the authors’ comments during discussion convincingly demonstrates that the method achieves consistent improvements in accuracy across multiple architectures, tasks and datasets. The algorithm is very simple (alternating between training the full dense network and a sparse version of it), which is actually a positive since that means it may get adapted in practice by the research community.

The paper should be revised to incorporate the additional experiments and comments from the discussion, particularly the accuracy comparisons with the same number of epochs. ",,8.0,3.0
835,True,DSD: Dense-Sparse-Dense Training for Deep Neural Networks,"Summary: 
The paper proposes a model training strategy to achieve higher accuracy. The issue is train a too large model and you going to over-fit and your model will capture noise. Prune models or make it too small then it will miss important connections and under-fit. Thus, the proposed method involves various training steps: first they train a dense network, then prune it making it sparse then train a sparse network and finally they add connections back and train the model as dense again (DSD). The DSD method is generic method that can be used in CNN/RNN/LSTM. The reasons why models have better accuracy after DSD are: escape of saddle point, sparsity makes model more robust to noise and symmetry break allowing richer representations.

Pro:
The main point that this paper wants to show is that a model has the capacity to achieve higher accuracy, because it was shown that it is possible to compress a model without losing accuracy. And lossless compression means that there’s significant redundancy in the models that were trained using current training methods. This is an important observation that large models can get better accuracies as better training schemes are used. 

Cons & Questions:
The issue is that the accuracy is slightly increased (2 or 3%) for most models. And the question is what is the price paid for this improvement? Resource and performance concerns arises because training a large model is computationally expensive (hours or even days using high performance GPUs).

Second question, can I keep adding Dense, Sparse and Dense training iterations to get higher and higher accuracy improvement? Are there limitations to this DSDSD… approach?


",,8.0,3.0
836,True,DSD: Dense-Sparse-Dense Training for Deep Neural Networks,"This paper presents a training strategy for deep networks.  First, the network is trained in a standard fashion.  Second, small magnitude weights are clamped to 0; the rest of the weights continue to be trained.  Finally, all the weights are again jointly trained.  Experiments on a variety of image, text, and speech datasets demonstrate the approach can obtain high-quality results.

The proposed idea is novel and interesting.  In a sense it is close to Dropout, though as noted in the paper the deterministic weight clamping method is different.

The main advantage of the proposed method is its simplicity.  Three hyper-parameters are needed: the number of weights to clamp to 0, and the numbers of epochs of training used in the first dense phase and the sparse phase.  Given these, it can be plugged in to training a range of networks, as shown in the experiments.

The concern I have is regarding the current empirical evaluation.  As noted in the question phase, it seems the baseline methods are not trained for as many epochs as the proposed method.  Standard tricks, such as dropping the learning rate upon ""convergence"" and continuing to learn, can be employed.  The response seems to indicate that these approaches can be effective.  I think a more thorough empirical analysis of performance over epochs, learning rates, etc. would strengthen the paper.  An exploration regarding the sparsity hyper-parameter would also be interesting.

837,False,Cat2Vec: Learning Distributed Representation of Multi-field Categorical Data,"In this paper, the author proposed an approach for feature combination of two embeddings v1 and v2. This is done by first computing the pairwise combinations of the elements of v1 and v2 (with complicated nonlinearity), and then pick the K-Max as the output vector. For triple (or higher-order) combinations, two (or more) consecutive pairwise combinations are performed to yield the final representations. It seems that the approach is not directly related to categorical data, and can be applied to any embeddings (even if they are not one-hot). So is there any motivation that brings about this particular approach? What is the connection? 

There are many papers with similar ideas. CCPM (A convolutional click prediction model) that the authors have compared against, also proposes very similar network structure (conv + K-max + conv + K-max). In the paper, the author does not mention their conceptual similarity and difference versus CCPM. Compact Bilinear Pooling,",,4.0,4.0
838,False,Cat2Vec: Learning Distributed Representation of Multi-field Categorical Data,"A method for click prediction is presented. Inputs are a categorical variables and output is the click-through-rate. The categorical input data is embedded into a feature vector using a discriminative scheme that tries to predict whether a sample is fake or not. The embedding vector is passed through a series of SUM/MULT gates and K-most important interactions are identified (K-max pooling). This process is repeated multiple times (i.e. multiple layers) and the final feature is passed into a fully connected layer to output the click prediction rate. 

Authors claim:
(1)	Use of gates and K-max pooling allow modeling of interactions that lead to state of art results. 
(2)	It is not straightforward to apply ideas in papers like word2vec to obtain feature embeddings and consequently they use the idea of discriminating between fake and true samples for feature learning. 

Theoretically convolutions can act as “sum” gates between pairs of input dimensions. Authors make these interactions explicit (i.e. imposed structure) by using gates. Now, the merit of the proposed method can be tested if a network using gates outperforms a network without gates. This baseline is critically missing – i.e. Embedding Vector followed by a series of convolution/pooling layers. 

Another related issue is that I am not sure if the number of parameters in the proposed model and the baseline models is similar or not. For instance – what is the total number of parameters in the CCPM model v/s the proposed model? 

Overall, there is no new idea in the paper. This by itself is not grounds for rejection if the paper outperforms established baselines.  However, such comparison is weak and I encourage authors to perform these comparisons.

839,False,Cat2Vec: Learning Distributed Representation of Multi-field Categorical Data,"The paper proposes a way to learn continuous features for input data which consists of multiple categorical data. The idea is to embed each category in a learnable low dimensional continuous space, explicitly compute the pair-wise interaction among different categories in a given input sample (which is achieved by either taking a component-wise dot product or component-wise addition), perform k-max pooling to select a subset of the most informative interactions, and repeat the process some number of times, until you get the final feature vector of the given input. This feature vector is then used as input to a classifier/regressor to accomplish the final task. The embeddings of the categories are learnt in the usual way. In the experiment section, the authors show on a synthetic dataset that their procedure is indeed able to select the relevant interactions in the data. On one real world dataset (iPinYou) the model seems to outperform a couple of simple baselines. 

My major concern with this paper is that their's nothing new in it. The idea of embedding the categorical data having mixed categories has already been handled in the past literature, where essentially one learns a separate lookup table for each class of categories: an input is represented by concatenation of the embeddings from these lookup table, and a non-linear function (a deep network) is plugged on top to get the features of the input. The only rather marginal contribution is the explicit modeling of the interactions among categories in equations 2/3/4/5. Other than that there's nothing else in the paper. 

Not only that, I feel that these interactions can (and should) automatically be learned by plugging in a deep convolutional network on top of the embeddings of the input. So I'm not sure how useful the contribution is. 

The experimental section is rather weak. They authors test their method on a single real world data set against a couple of rather weak baselines. I would have much preferred for them to evaluate against numerous models proposed in the literature which handle similar problems, including wsabie. 

While the authors argued in their response that wsabie was not suited for their problem, i strongly disagree with that claim. While the original wsabie paper showed experiments using images as inputs, their training methodology can easily be extended to other types of data sets, including categorical data. For instance, I conjecture that the model i proposed above (embed all the categorical inputs, concatenate the embeddings, plug a deep conv-net on top and train using some margin loss) will perform as well if not better than the hand coded interaction model proposed in this paper. Of course I could be wrong, but it would be far more convincing if their model was tested against such baselines. ",,5.0,5.0
840,False,Semantic Noise Modeling for Better Representation Learning,"This paper introduces a maximum total correlation procedure, adds a target and then adds noise perturbations.

Technical issues:

The move from (1) to (2) is problematic. Yes it is a lower bound, but by igoring H(Z), equation (2) ignores the fact that H(Z) will potentially vary more significantly that H(Z|Y). As a result of removing H(Z), the objective (2) encourages Z that are low entropy as the H(Z) term is ignored, doubly so as low entropy Z results in low entropy Z|Y. Yes the -H(X|Z) mitigates against a complete entropy collapse for H(Z), but it still neglects critical terms. In fact one might wonder if this is the reason that semantic noise addition needs to be done anyway, just to push up the entropy of Z to stop it reducing too much.

In (3) arbitrary balancing paramters lamda_1 and lambda_2 are introduced ex-nihilo - they were not there in (2). This is not ever justified.

Then in (5), a further choice is made by simply adding L_{NLL} to the objective. But in the supervised case, the targets are known and so turn up in H(Z|Y). Hence now H(Z|Y) should be conditioned on the targets. However instead another objective is added again without justification, and the conditional entropy of Z is left disconnected from the data it is to be conditioned on. One might argue the C(X,Y,Z) simply acts as a prior on the networks (and hence implicitly on the weights) that we consider, which is then combined with a likelihood term, but this case is not made. In fact there is no explicit probabilistic or information theoretic motivation for the chosen objective.

Given these issues, it is then not too surprising that some further things need to be done, such as semantic noise addition to actually get things working properly. It may be the form of noise addition is a good idea, but given the troublesome objective being used in the first place, it is very hard to draw conclusions.

In summary, substantially better theoretical justification of the chosen model is needed, before any reasonable conclusion on the semantic noise modelling can be made.",,2.0,4.0
841,False,Semantic Noise Modeling for Better Representation Learning,"The paper introduces supervised deep learning with layer-wise reconstruction loss (in addition to the supervised loss) and class-conditional semantic additive noise for better representation learning. Total correlation measure and additional insights from auto-encoder are used to derive layer-wise reconstruction loss and is further combined with supervised loss. When combining with supervised loss the class-conditional additive noise model is proposed, which showed consistent improvement over the baseline model. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets while changing the number of training examples per class are done extensively.

The derivation of Equation (3) from total correlation is hacky. Moreover, assuming graphical model between X, Y and Z, it should be more carefully derived to estimate H(X|Z) and H(Z|Y). The current proposal, encoding Z and Y from X and decoding from encoded representation is not really well justified.

Is \sigma in Equation 8 trainable parameter or hyperparameter? If it is trainable how it is trained? If it is not, how are they set? Does j correspond to one of the class? The proposed feature augmentation sounds like simply adding gaussian noise to the pre-softmax neurons. That being said, the proposed method is not different from gaussian dropout (Wang and Manning, ICML 2013) but applied on different layers. In addition, there is a missing reference (DisturbLabel: Regularizing CNN on the Loss Layer, CVPR 2016) that applied synthetic noise process on the loss layer.

842,False,Semantic Noise Modeling for Better Representation Learning,"The paper presents a new regularization technique for neural networks, which seeks to maximize correlation between input variables, latent variables and outputs. This is achieved by defining a measure of total correlation between these variables and decomposing it in terms of entropies and conditional entropies.

Authors explain that they do not actually maximize the total correlation, but a lower-bound of it that ignores simple entropy terms, and only considers conditional entropies. It is not clearly explained what is the rationale for discarding these entropy terms.

Entropies measures are applying to probability distributions (i.e. this implies that the variables in the model should be random). The link between the conditional entropy formulation and the reconstruction error is not made explicit. In order to link these two views, I would have expected, for example, a noise model for the units of the network.

Later in the paper, it is claimed that the original ladder network is not suitable for supervised learning with small samples, and some empirical results seek to demonstrate this. But a more theoretical explanation why it is the case would have been welcome.

843,False,Local minima in training of deep networks,"The paper studies some special cases of neural networks and datasets where optimization fails. Most of the considered models and datasets are however highly constructed and do not follow the basic hyperparameters selection and parameter initialization heuristics. This reduces the practical relevance of the analysis.

The experiment ""bad initialization on MNIST"" shows that for very negative biases or weights drawn from a non-centered distribution, all ReLU activations are ""off"" for all data points, and thus, optimization is prevented. This never occurs in practice, because using proper initialization heuristics avoid these cases.

The ""jellyfish"" dataset constructed by the authors is demonstrated to be difficult to fit by a small model. However, the size/depth of the considered model is unsuitable for this problem.

Proposition 4 assumes that we can choose the mean from which the weight parameters are initialized. This is typically not the case in practice as most initialization heuristics draw weight parameters from a distribution with mean 0.

Proposition 5 considers infinitely deep ReLU networks. Very deep networks would however preferably be of type ResNet.",,3.0,5.0
844,False,Local minima in training of deep networks,"The main merit of this paper is to draw again attention to how crucial initialization of deep network *can* be; and to counter the popular impression that modern architectures and improved gradient descent techniques make optimization local minima and saddle points no longer a  problem. 

While the paper provides interesting counter-examples that showcase how bad initialization mixed with particular data can lead the optimization to get stuck at a poor solution, these feel like contrived artificial constructs. More importantly the paper does not consider popular heuristics that likely help to avoid getting stuck, such as: non-saturating activation functions (e.g. leaky RELU), batch-norm, skip connections (resnet), that can all be thought of as contributing to keep the gradients flowing. 

The paper puts up a big warning sign about potential initialization problems (with standard RELU nets), but without proposing new solutions or workarounds, nor carrying out a systematic analysis of how this picture is affected by most commonly used current heuristic techniques (in architecture, initialization and training). Such a broader scope analysis, especially if it did lead to insights of practical relevance, could much increase the value of the paper for the reader.

845,False,Local minima in training of deep networks,"This paper studies the error surface of deep rectifier networks, giving specific examples for which the error surface has local minima. Several experimental results show that learning can be trapped at apparent local minima by a variety of factors ranging from the nature of the dataset to the nature of the initializations. This paper develops a lot of good intuitions and useful examples of ways that training can go awry. 

Even though the examples constructed in this paper are contrived, this does not necessarily remove their theoretical importance. It is very useful to have simple examples where things go wrong. However the broader theoretical framing of the paper appears to be going after a strawman.

“The underlying easiness of optimizing deep networks does not simply rest just in the emerging structures due to high dimensional spaces, but is rather tightly connected to the intrinsic characteristics of the data these models are run on.” I believe this perspective is already contained in several of the works cited as not belonging to this perspective. Choromanska et al., for instance, analyze Gaussian inputs, and so clearly make claims based on characteristics of the data the models are run on. More broadly, the loss function is determined jointly by the dataset and the model parameters, and so no account of the error surface can be separated from dataset properties. It is not clear to me what ‘emerging structures due to high dimensional spaces’ are, or what they could be, that would make them independent of the dataset and initial model parameters. The emerging structure of the error surface is necessarily related to the dataset and model parameters.

Again, a key worry with this paper is that it is aiming at a strawman: replica methods characterize average behavior for infinite systems, so it is not surprising that specific finite sized systems might yield poor optimization landscapes. The paper seems surprised that training can be broken with a bad initialization, but initialization is known to be critical, even for linear networks: saddle points are not innocuous, with bad initializations dramatically slowing learning (e.g. Saxe et al. 2014).

It seems like the proof of proposition 5 may have an error. Suppose cdf_b(0) = 0 and cdf_W(0)=1/2. We have P(learning fails) >= 1 - 1/2^{h^2(k-1)}, meaning that the probability of failure _increases_ as the number of hidden units increases. It seems like it should rather be (ignoring the bias) p(fails) >= 1 - [ 1 - p(w<0)^h^2]^{k-1}. In this case the limit as k-> infinity depends on how h scales with k, so it is no longer necessarily true that “one does not have a globally good behaviour of learning regardless of the model size.”

The paper also appears to insufficiently distinguish between local minima and saddle points. Section 3.1 states it shows training being stuck in a local minimum, but this is based on training with a fixed budget of epochs. It is not possible to tell whether this result reflects a genuine local minimum or a saddle point based on simulation results. 
It may also be the case that, while rectifiers suffer from genuine blind spots, sigmoid or soft rectifier nonlinearities may not. On the XOR problem with two hidden nodes, for instance, it was thought that were local minima but in fact there are none (e.g. L. Hamey, “Analysis of the error surface of the XOR network with two hidden nodes,” 1995). 

If the desire is simply to show that training does not converge for particular finite problems, much simpler counterexamples can be constructed and would suffice: set all hidden unit weights to zero, for instance. 

In the response to prereview questions, the authors write ‘If the “complete characterization” [of the error surface] was indeed universally valid, we would not be able to break the learning with the initialization’ but, as mentioned previously, the basic results for even deep linear networks show that a bad initialization (at or near a saddle point) will break learning. Again, it seems this paper is attacking a straw man along the lines of “nothing can possibly go wrong with neural network training.” No prior theoretical result claims this. 

The Figure 2 explanation seems counterintuitive to me. Simply scaling the input, if the weight matrices are initialized with zero biases, will not change the regions over which each ReLU activates. That is, this manipulation does not achieve the goal of concentrating “most of the data points in very few linear regions.” A far more likely explanation is that the much weaker scaling has not been compensated by the learning algorithm, but the algorithm would converge if run longer. The response notes that training has been conducted for an order of magnitude longer than required for the unscaled input to converge, but the scaling on the data is not one but five orders of magnitude—and indeed the training does converge without issue for scaling up to four orders of magnitude. The response notes that Adam should compensate for the scaling factor, but this depends on the details of the Adam implementation—the epsilon factor used to protect against division by zero, for example.

846,True,Learning Invariant Feature Spaces to Transfer Skills with Reinforcement Learning,"The paper considers the problem of transferring skills between robots with different morphologies, in the context of agents that have to perform several tasks.  A core component of the proposed approach is to use a task-invariant future space, which can be shared between tasks & between agents.

Compared to previous work (Ammar et al. 2015), it seems the main contribution here is to “assume that good correspondences in episodic tasks can be extracted through time alignment” (Sec. 2).  This is an interesting hypothesis. There is also similarity to work by Raimalwala et al (2016), but the authors argue their method is better equipped to handle non-linear dynamics. These are two interesting hypotheses, however I don’t see that they have been verified in the presented empirical results.  In particular, the question of the pairing correspondence seems crucial. What happens when the time alignment is not suitable. Is it possible to use dynamic time warping (or similar method) to achieve reasonable results?  Robustness to misspecification of the pairing correspondence P seems a major concern.

In general, more comparison to other transfer methods, including those listed in Sec.2, would be very valuable.  The addition of Sec.5.1 is definitely a right step in this direction, but represents a small portion of the recent work on transfer learning.  I appreciate that other methods transfer other pieces of information (e.g. the policy), but still if the end goal is better performance, what is worth transferring (in addition to how to do the transfer) should be a reasonable question to explore.

Overall, the paper tackles an important problem, but this is a very active area of research, and further comparison to other methods would be worthwhile.  The method proposed of transferring the representation is well motivated, cleanly described, and conceptually sound.  The assumption that time alignment can be used for the state pairing seems problematic, and should be further validated.",,6.0,4.0
847,True,Learning Invariant Feature Spaces to Transfer Skills with Reinforcement Learning,"This paper presents an approach for skills transfer from one task to another in a control setting (trained by RL) by forcing the embeddings learned on two different tasks to be close (L2 penalty). The experiments are conducted in MuJoCo, with a set of experiments being from the state of the joints/links (5.2/5.3) and a set of experiments on the pixels (5.4). They exhibit transfer from arms with different number of links, and from a torque-driven arm to a tendon-driven arm.

One limitation of the paper is that the authors suppose that time alignment is trivial, because the tasks are all episodic and in the same domain. Time alignment is one form of domain adaptation / transfer that is not dealt with in the paper, that could be dealt with through subsampling, dynamic time warping, or learning a matching function (e.g. neural network).

General remarks: The approach is compared to CCA, which is a relevant baseline. However, as the paper is purely experimental, another baseline (worse than CCA) would be to just have the random projections for ""f"" and ""g"" (the embedding functions on the two domains), to check that the bad performance of the ""no transfer"" version of the model is due to over-specialisation of these embeddings. I would also add (for information) that the problem of learning invariant feature spaces is also linked to metric learning (e.g. [Xing et al. 2002]). More generally, no parallel is drawn with multi-task learning in ML. In the case of knowledge transfer (4.1.1), it may make sense to anneal \alpha.

The experiments feel a bit rushed. In particular, the performance of the baseline being always 0 (no transfer at all) is uninformative, at least a much bigger sample budget should be tested. Also, why does Figure 7.b contain no ""CCA"" nor ""direct mapping"" results? Another concern that I have with the experiments: (if/how) did the author control for the fact that the embeddings were trained with more iterations in the case of doing transfer?

Overall, the study of transfer is most welcomed in RL. The experiments in this paper are interesting enough for publication, but the paper could have been more thorough.",,7.0,3.0
848,True,Learning Invariant Feature Spaces to Transfer Skills with Reinforcement Learning,"
This paper explores transfer in reinforcement learning between agents that may be morphologically distinct. The key idea is for the source and target agent to have learned a shared skill, and then to use this to construct abstract feature spaces to enable the transfer of a new unshared skill in the source agent to the target agent. The paper is related to much other work on transfer that uses shared latent spaces, such as CCA and its variants, including manifold alignment and kernel CCA. 


The paper reports on experiments using a simple physics simulator between robot arms consisting of three vs. four links. For comparison, a simple CCA based approach is shown, although it would have been preferable to see comparisons for something more current and up to date, such as manifold alignment or kernel CCA. A three layer neural net is used to construct the latent feature spaces. 

The problem of transfer in RL is extremely important, and receives less attention than it should. This work uses an interesting hypothesis of trying to construct transfer based on shared skills between source and target agent. This is a promising approach. However, the comparisons to related approaches is not very up to date, and the domains are fairly simplistic. There is little by way of theoretical development of the ideas using MDP theory.

849,False,Learning a Static Analyzer: A Case Study on a Toy Language,"The authors explore the idea of deep-learning a static analyzer. They do it with a toy programming language and a very simplified analysis problem -- just checking if all variables are initalized.

While the idea is interesting and might be developped into a tool in the future, the toy task presented in this paper is too simple to warrant an ICLR submission. Just detecting whether a variable is initialized in a string is a toy algorihtmic task, similar to the ones solved in a number of paper in recent years by models such as the Neural Turing Machine, Stack RNNs, Neural GPU, or Differentiable Neural Computer. All these architectures perform almost perfectly on a number of algorithmic tasks, so it is highly probable that they would also solve this one. Unluckily, the authors only compare to much more basic models, such as HMMs. Since the code for many of the above-mentioned models is available online, a paper without these baselines is not ready for ICLR. Moreover, there is a risk that existing models already solve this problem very well, making the contribution unclear.",,3.0,5.0
850,False,Learning a Static Analyzer: A Case Study on a Toy Language,"This paper takes a first step towards learning to statically analyze source code. It develops a simple toy programming language that includes loops and branching. The aim is to determine whether all variables in the program are defined before they are used. The paper tries a variety of off-the-shelf sequence classification models and develops a new model that makes use of a ``differentiable set'' to keep track of which variables have been defined so far. Result show that an LSTM model can achieve 98% accuracy, and the differentiable set model can achieve 99.3% accuracy with sequence-level supervision and 99.7% accuracy with strong token-level supervision. An additional result is used whereby an LSTM language model is trained over correct code, and then low probability (where a threshold to determine low is tuned by hand) tokens are highlighted as sources of possible error.

One further question is if the authors could clarify what reasoning patterns are needed to solve these problems. Does the model need to, e.g., statically determine whether an `if` condition can ever evaluate to true in order to solve these tasks? Or is it just as simple as checking whether a variable appears on a LHS before it appears on a RHS later in the textual representation of the program?

Strengths:
- Learning a static analyzer is an interesting concept, and I think there is good potential for this line of work
- The ability to determine whether variables are defined before they are used is certainly a prerequisite for more complicated static analysis.
- The experimental setup seems reasonable
- The differentiable set seems like a useful (albeit simple) modelling tool

Weaknesses:
- The setup is very toy, and it's not clear to me that this makes much progress towards the challenges that would arise if one were trying to learn a static analyzer 
- The models are mostly very simple. The one novelty on the modelling front (the differentiable set) provides a small win on this task, but it's not clear if it is a useful general construct or not.

Overall:
I think it's an interesting start, and I'm eager to see how this line of work progresses. In my opinion, it's a bit too early to accept this work to ICLR, but I'd be excited about seeing what happens as the authors try to push the system to learn to analyze more properties of code, and as they push towards scenarios where the learned static analyzer would be useful, perhaps leveraging strengths of machine learning that are not available to standard programming languages analyses.",,4.0,4.0
851,False,Learning a Static Analyzer: A Case Study on a Toy Language,"The authors are trying to understand whether static analysis can be learned. As I hinted in my question, I think that all of the interesting complexity of static analysis has been removed in the toy language --- extraordinarily simple logic using a set can solve the problem posed, and an LSTM (unsurprisingly) can learn the extraordinarily simple logic (when given a differentiable set object). This extreme simplicity gives me no confidence that a more realistic static analysis problem can be solved.

LSTMs (and deep learning) have had remarkable successes in solving messy real-world language problems. It's certainly possible that LSTMs could solve static analysis -- but being technically timid is not the right way to go about it.",,3.0,4.0
852,False,Learning a Static Analyzer: A Case Study on a Toy Language,"-- The motivation behind the work is somewhat unclear: by now, it is very well understood how to design analyzers and what sound/optimal means. Creating a ``black box'' analyzer that can make basic predictions (that are sometimes incorrect) without being able to modify it would be useful if the predictions were challenging and need not be sound all the time (like in some of the cited papers). Note that when analyzers are not sound there are typically clear  reasons for why this is so, e.g., dealing with native methods, frameworks, dynamic evaluation, etc. They are not unsound for 'random reasons'.

853,True,SampleRNN: An Unconditional End-to-End Neural Audio Generation Model,"The paper introduces SampleRNN, a hierarchical recurrent neural network model of raw audio. The model is trained end-to-end and evaluated using log-likelihood and by human judgement of unconditional samples, on three different datasets covering speech and music. This evaluation shows the proposed model to compare favourably to the baselines.

It is shown that the subsequence length used for truncated BPTT affects performance significantly, but interestingly, a subsequence length of 512 samples (~32 ms) is sufficient to get good results, even though the features of the data that are modelled span much longer timescales. This is an interesting and somewhat unintuitive result that I think warrants a bit more discussion.

The authors have attempted to reimplement WaveNet, an alternative model of raw audio that is fully convolutional. They were unable to reproduce the exact model architecture from the original paper, but have attempted to build an instance of the model with a receptive field of about 250ms that could be trained in a reasonable time using their computational resources, which is commendable.

The architecture of the Wavenet model is described in detail, but it found it challenging to find the same details for the proposed SampleRNN architecture (e.g. which value of ""r"" is used for the different tiers, how many units per layer, ...). I think a comparison in terms of computational cost, training time and number of parameters would also be very informative.

Surprisingly, Table 1 shows a vanilla RNN (LSTM) substantially outperforming this model in terms of likelihood, which is quite suspicious as LSTMs tend to have effective receptive fields of a few hundred timesteps at best. One would expect the much larger receptive field of the Wavenet model to be reflected in the likelihood scores to some extent. Similarly, Figure 3 shows the vanilla RNN outperforming the Wavenet reimplementation in human evaluation on the Blizzard dataset. This raises questions about the implementation of the latter. Some discussion about this result and whether the authors expected it or not would be very welcome.

Table 1 and Figure 4 also show the 2-tier SampleRNN outperforming the 3-tier model in terms of likelihood and human rating respectively, which is very counterintuitive as one would expect longer-range temporal correlations to be even more relevant for music than for speech. This is not discussed at all, I think it would be useful to comment on why this could be happening.

Overall, this an interesting attempt to tackle modelling very long sequences with long-range temporal correlations and the results are quite convincing, even if the same can't always be said of the comparison with the baselines. It would be interesting to see how the model performs for conditional generation, seeing as it can be more easily be objectively compared to models like Wavenet in that domain.



Other remarks:

- upsampling the output of the models is done with r separate linear projections. This choice of upsampling method is not motivated. Why not just use linear interpolation or nearest neighbour upsampling? What is the advantage of learning this operation? Don't the r linear projections end up learning largely the same thing, give or take some noise?

- The third paragraph of Section 2.1.1 indicates that 8-bit linear PCM was used. This is in contrast to Wavenet, for which an 8-bit mu-law encoding was used, and this supposedly improves the audio fidelity of the samples. Did you try this as well?

- Section 2.1 mentions the discretisation of the input and the use of a softmax to model this discretised input, without any reference to prior work that made the same observation. A reference is given in 2.1.1, but it should probably be moved up a bit to avoid giving the impression that this is a novel observation.",,8.0,4.0

The authors attempted to compare with wavenet model, but they didn't manage to get a model better than the baseline LSTM-RNN, which makes all the comparisons to wavenets less convincing. Hence, instead of wasting time and space comparing to wavenet, detailing the proposed model would be better. ",,9.0,4.0
855,True,SampleRNN: An Unconditional End-to-End Neural Audio Generation Model,"Pros:
The authors are presenting an RNN-based alternative to wavenet, for generating audio a sample at a time.
RNNs are a natural candidate for this task so this is an interesting alternative. Furthermore the authors claim to make significant improvement in the quality of the produces samples.
Another novelty here is that they use a quantitative likelihood-based measure to assess them model, in addition to the AB human comparisons used in the wavenet work.

Cons:
The paper is lacking equations that detail the model. This can be remedied in the camera-ready version.
The paper is lacking detailed explanations of the modeling choices:
- It's not clear why an MLP is used in the bottom layer instead of (another) RNN.
- It's not clear why r linear projections are used for up-sampling, instead of feeding the same state to all r samples, or use a more powerful type of transformation. 
As the authors admit, their wavenet implementation is probably not as good as the original one, which makes the comparisons questionable.

856,True,SampleRNN: An Unconditional End-to-End Neural Audio Generation Model,"The paper looks very nice and the results are even better. However, I must clearly state that the way that you have defined your model lacks any mathematical formalism. The main definition in the paper is literally Figure 1, with literally 2 equations in the whole paper, where one of them is just defining an ordered cascade definition of a joint distribution (eq 1). It is stated that each of the modules operates on a different FS_k time window, but how are these combined with the previous h-vector and with the one coming from the upper modules is not stated and remains a mystery, unless I go and read your code. Also interestingly enough the lowest level module uses an MLP rather than some form of an RNN to combine the observation in its window and the conditioning vector c. I'm very confused on why is that the case, and did you just stack all of the FS_1 vectors and input them to the MLP? Did you try to have another RNN there rather than an MLP? Does this implies that at every new iteration t, we need to compute the MLP at every level a new? 

Also your answer to Soroush Mehri 3) - ""You can find the code and best found hyper-parameters in the following Github repo"" is really unsatisfactory. As a researcher I will need to spent several hours digging trough your code, written in Theano, which for that matter many people might have never used before, in order to just understand what exactly are you doing. On the other hand you can just explain in probably 3 equations the whole model and another 2 sentences about what were the number of hidden units etc... Also speaking about research, you should NOT just report the best chosen hyper parameters. The whole community will benefit a lot more if you list all of the things you tried and how well did they do (if needed add this in an Appendix).

857,False,Revisiting Batch Normalization For Practical Domain Adaptation,"This paper proposes a simple domain adaptation technique in which batch normalization is performed separately in each domain.


Pros:

The method is very simple and easy to understand and apply.

The experiments demonstrate that the method compares favorably with existing methods on standard domain adaptation tasks.

The analysis in section 4.3.2 shows that a very small number of target domain samples are needed for adaptation of the network.


Cons:

There is little novelty -- the method is arguably too simple to be called a “method.” Rather, it’s the most straightforward/intuitive approach when using a network with batch normalization for domain adaptation.  The alternative -- using the BN statistics from the source domain for target domain examples -- is less natural, to me. (I guess this alternative is what’s done in the Inception BN results in Table 1-2?)

The analysis in section 4.3.1 is superfluous except as a sanity check -- KL divergence between the distributions should be 0 when each distribution is shifted/scaled to N(0,1) by BN.

Section 3.3: it’s not clear to me what point is being made here.


Overall, there’s not much novelty here, but it’s hard to argue that simplicity is a bad thing when the method is clearly competitive with or outperforming prior work on the standard benchmarks (in a domain adaptation tradition that started with “Frustratingly Easy Domain Adaptation”).  If accepted, Sections 4.3.1 and 3.3 should be removed or rewritten for clarity for a final version.",,6.0,3.0
858,False,Revisiting Batch Normalization For Practical Domain Adaptation,"Update: I thank the authors for their comments. I still think that the method needs more experimental evaluation: for now, it's restricted to the settings in which one can use pre-trained ImageNet model, but it's also important to show the effectiveness in scenarios where one needs to train everything from scratch. I would love to see a fair comparison of the state-of-the-art methods on toy datasets (e.g. see (Bousmalis et al., 2016), (Ganin & Lempitsky, 2015)). In my opinion, it's a crucial point that doesn't allow me to increase the rating.

This paper proposes a simple trick turning batch normalization into a domain adaptation technique. The authors show that per-batch means and variances normally computed as a part of the BN procedure are sufficient to discriminate the domain. This observation leads to an idea that adaptation for the target domain can be performed by replacing population statistics computed on the source dataset by the corresponding statistics from the target dataset.

Overall, I think the paper is more suitable for a workshop track rather than for the main conference track. My main concerns are the following:

1. Although the main idea is very simple, it feels like the paper is composed in such a way to make the main contribution less obvious (e.g. the idea could have been described in the abstract but the authors avoided doing so). 

2. (This one is from the pre-review questions) The authors are using much stronger base CNN which may account for the bulk of the reported improvement. In order to prove the effectiveness of the trick, the authors would need to conduct a fair comparison against competing methods. It would be highly desirable to conduct this comparison also in the case of a model trained from scratch (as opposed to reusing ImageNet-trained networks).

While the idea of using chirplet transform is interesting, my main concern is that the empirical evidence provided is in a rather narrow domain of bird call classification.

862,True,Learning to Compose Words into Sentences with Reinforcement Learning,"In this paper, the authors propose a new method to learn hierarchical representations of sentences, based on reinforcement learning. They propose to learn a neural shift-reduce parser, such that the induced tree structures lead to good performance on a downstream task. They use reinforcement learning (more specifically, the policy gradient method REINFORCE) to learn their model. The reward of the algorithm is the evaluation metric of the downstream task. The authors compare two settings, (1) no structure information is given (hence, the only supervision comes from the downstream task) and (2) actions from an external parser is used as supervision to train the policy network, in addition to the supervision from the downstream task. The proposed approach is evaluated on four tasks: sentiment analysis, semantic relatedness, textual entailment and sentence generation.

I like the idea of learning tree representations of text which are useful for a downstream task. The paper is clear and well written. However, I am not convinced by the experimental results presented in the paper. Indeed, on most tasks, the proposed model is far from state-of-the-art models:
 - sentiment analysis, 86.5 v.s. 89.7 (accuracy);
 - semantic relatedness, 0.32 v.s. 0.25 (MSE);
 - textual entailment, 80.5 v.s. 84.6 (accuracy).
From the results presented in the paper, it is hard to know if these results are due to the model, or because of the reinforcement learning algorithm.

 - interesting idea: learning structures of sentences adapted for a downstream task.
 - well written paper.

 - weak experimental results (do not really support the claim of the authors).

Nobody has gotten that to work yet in any really groundbreaking or influential way that results in actually superior performance on any highly relevant or competitive NLP task.
Most people struggle with the fact that NLP requires very efficient methods on very large datasets and RL is super slow.
Hence, I believe this direction hasn't shown much promise yet and it's not yet clear it ever will due to the slowness of RL.
But many directions need to be explored and maybe eventually they will reach a point where they become relevant.

The experiments on four datasets (SST, SICK, IMDB, and SNLI) show that the proposed approach outperformed the approach using predefined tree structures (e.g. left-to-right, right-to-left). 

The paper is well written and has two good points. Firstly, the idea of using RL to learn parse trees using downstream tasks is very interesting and novel. And employing the shift-reduce framework is a very smart choice because the set of actions is minimal (shift and reduce). Secondly, what shown in the paper somewhat confirms the need of parse trees. This is indeed interesting because of the current debate on whether syntax is helpful.

I have the following comments:
- it seems that the authors weren't aware of some recent work using RL to learn structures for composition, e.g. Andreas et al (2016).
- because different composition functions (e.g. LSTM, GRU, or classical recursive neural net) have different inductive biases, I was wondering if the tree structures found by the model would be independent from the composition function choice.
- because RNNs in theory are equivalent to Turing machines, I was wondering if restricting the expressiveness of the model (e.g. reducing the dimension) can help the model focus on discovering more helpful tree structures.

869,False,Taming the waves: sine as activation function in deep neural networks,"Summary:
In this paper, the authors explore the advantages/disadvantages of using a sin activation function.
They first demonstrate that even with simple tasks, using sin activations can result in complex to optimize loss functions.
They then compare networks trained with different activations on the MNIST dataset, and discover that the periodicity of the sin activation is not necessary for learning the task well.
They then try different algorithmic tasks, where the periodicity of the functions is helpful.

Pros:
The closed form derivations of the loss surface were interesting to see, and the clarity of tone on the advantages *and* disadvantages was educational.

Cons: 
Seems like more of a preliminary investigation of the potential benefits of sin, and more evidence (to support or in contrary) is needed to conclude anything significant -- the results on MNIST seem to indicate truncated sin is just as good, and while it is interesting that tanh maybe uses more of the saturated part, the two seem relatively interchangeable.

The model is evaluated on several datasets. While it does not achieve state-of-the-art performance, it advances an interesting class of models. The paper is mostly well written and clear.

Given that inference and generation are both efficient and exact, and given that this represents a main advantage over other models, it would be great if the authors could provide some motivating example applications where this is needed/would be useful.

The authors claim that “unlike both variational autoencoders and GANs, our technique is able to learn a semantically meaningful latent space which is as high dimensional as the input space.” Where is the evidence for this claim? I didn’t see any analysis of the semantic meaningfulness of the latent space learned by real NVP. Stronger evidence that the learned representations are actually useful for downstream tasks would be nice.

I still think the author’s intuitions around the “fixed reconstruction cost of L2” are very vague. The factorial Gaussian assumption itself does not limit the generative model, it merely smoothes an otherwise arbitrary distribution, and to a degree which can be arbitrarily small, p(x) = \int p(z) N(x | f(z), \sigma^2) dz. How a lose lower bound plays into this is not clear from the paper.",,7.0,4.0
872,True,Density estimation using Real NVP,"This paper presents a clever way of training a generative model which allows for exact inference, sampling and log likelihood evaluation. The main idea here is to make the Jacobian that comes when using the change of variables formula (from data to latents) triangular - this makes the determinant easy to calculate and hence learning possible. 
The paper nicely presents this core idea and a way to achieve this - by choosing special ""routings"" between the latents and data such that part of the transformation is identity and part some complex function of the input (a deep net, for example) the resulting Jacobian has a tractable structure. This routing can be cascaded to achieve even more complex transformation. 

On the experimental side, the model is trained on several datasets and the results are quite convincing, both in sample quality and quantitive measures. 
I would be very happy to see if this model is useful with other types of tasks and if the resulting latent representation help with classification or inference such as image restoration.

Generative models with tractable inference and efficient sampling are an active research area and this paper definitely contributes to this field.

While not achieving state-of-the-art, they are not far behind. This doesn't change the fact that the proposed method is innovative and worth exploring as it tries to bridge the gap between auto-regressive models, variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks.

The authors clearly mention the difference and similarities with other types of generative models that are being actively researched.
Compared to autoregressive models, the proposed approach offers fast sampling.
Compared to generative adversarial networks, Real NVP offers a tractable log-likelihood evaluation.

The authors demonstrate that their method outperforms reasonable baselines on (small to mid-sized) real world datasets. The paper is clearly written.
IMO the authors propose a reasonable approach for dealing with missing values for their intended application domain, where data is not abundant and requires smallish models. I’m somewhat sceptical if the benefits would carry over to big datasets, where more general, less handcrafted multi-layer RNNs are an option.",,6.0,3.0
875,False,Recurrent Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series with Missing Values,"This paper presents a modified gated RNN caled GRU-D that deals with time series which display a lot of missing values in their input. They work on two fronts. The first deals with the missing inputs directly by using a learned convex combination of the previous available value (forward imputation) and the mean value (mean imputation). The second includes dampening the recurrent layer not unlike a second reset gate, but parametrized according to the time elapsed since the last available value of each attributes.

Positives
------------
- Clear definition of the task (handling missing values for classification of time series)
- Many interesting baselines to test the new model against.
- The model presented deals with the missing values in a novel, ML-type way (learn new dampening parameters).
- The extensive tests done on the datasets is probably the greatest asset of this paper.

Negatives
-------------
- The paper could use some double checking for typos.
- The Section A.2.3 really belongs in the main article as it deals with important related works. Swap it with the imprecise diagrams of the model if you need space.
- No mention of any methods from the statistics litterature.

Here are the two main points of this review that informs my decision:

1. The results, while promising, are below expectations. The paper hasn’t been able to convince me that GRU-simple (without intervals) isn’t just as well-suited for the task of handling missing inputs as GRU-D. In the main paper, GRU-simple is presented as the main baseline. Yet, it includes a lot of extraneous parameters (the intervals) that, according to Table 5, probably hurts the model more than it helps it. Having a third of it’s parameters being of dubious value, it brings the question of the fairness of the comparison done in the main paper, especially since in the one table where GRU-simple (without intervals) is present, GRU-D doesn’t significantly outperforms it.

2. My second concern, and biggest, is with some claims that are peppered through the paper. The first is about the relationship with the presence rate of data in the dataset and the diagnostics. I might be wrong, but that only indicates that the doctor in charge of that patient requested the relevant analyses be done according to the patient’s condition. That would mean that an expert system based on this data would always seem to be one step behind. 
The second claim is the last sentence of the introduction, which sets huge expectations that were not met by the paper. Another is that “simply concatenating masking and time interval vectors fails to exploit the temporal structure of missing values” is unsubstantiated and actually disproven later in the paper. 
Yet another is the conclusion that since GRU models displayed the best improvement between a subsample of the dataset and the whole of it means that the improvement is going to continue to grow as more data is added. This fails to consider that non-GRU models actually started with much better results than most GRU ones. 
Lastly is their claim to capture informative missingness by incorporating masking and time intervals directly inside the GRU architecture. While the authors did make these changes, the fact that they also concatenate the mask to the input, just like GRU-simple (without intervals), leads me to question the actual improvement made by GRU-D. 

Given that, while I find that the work that has been put into the paper is above average, I wouldn’t accept that paper without a reframing of the findings and a better focus on the real contribution of this paper, which I believe is the novel way to parametrize the choice of imputation method.",,6.0,4.0
876,False,Recurrent Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series with Missing Values,"This paper proposed a way to deal with supervised multivariate time series tasks involving missing values.

pros: 
1) the insight of utilizing missing value is critical. the observation of decaying effect in the healthcare application is also interesting;
2) the experiment seems to be solid; the baseline algorithms and analysis of results are also done properly.

878,False,On orthogonality and learning recurrent networks with long term dependencies,"Vanishing and exploding gradients makes the optimization of RNNs very challenging. The issue becomes worse on tasks with long term dependencies that requires longer RNNs. One of the suggested approaches to improve the optimization is to optimize in a way that the transfer matrix is almost orthogonal. This paper investigate the role of orthogonality on the optimization and learning which is very important. The writing is sound and clear and arguments are easy to follow. The suggested optimization method is very interesting. The main shortcoming of this paper is the experiments which I find very important and I hope authors can update the experiment section significantly. Below I mention some comments on the experiment section:

1- I think the experiments are not enough. At the very least, report the result on the adding problem and language modeling task on Penn Treebank.

2- I understand that the copying task becomes difficult with non-lineary. However, removing non-linearity makes the optimization very different and therefore, it is very hard to conclude anything from the results on the copying task.

3- I was not able to find the number of hidden units used for RNNs in different tasks.

4- Please report the running time of your method in the paper for different numbers of hidden units, compare it with the SGD and mention the NN package you have used.

5- The results on Table 1 and Table 2 might also suggest that the orthogonality is not really helpful since even without a margin, the numbers are very close compare to the case when you find the optimal margin. Am I right?

6- What do we learn from Figure 2? It is left without any discussion.",,5.0,5.0
879,False,On orthogonality and learning recurrent networks with long term dependencies,"As requested, we have performed a number of additional experiments and added them to the paper draft. The new experiments can be summarized as follows:

[Adding task]
We explored the use of different spectral margins on a synthetic adding task with a transition nonlinearity. A purely orthogonal model (margin=0) and one with no margin failed to converge beyond the baseline level on this task; however, models with non-zero margins began to converge beyond the baseline.

[Penn Treebank]
We have explored the use of different spectral margins for character prediction on Penn Treebank using two setups. (1) A subset (about 23%) of the data containing sentences with up to 75 characters. (2) A subset (over 99%) of the data containing sentences with up to 300 characters.

[Parametric ReLU on the copy task]
We explored the use of a trainable non-linearity on the copy task and found that it learns to nearly become an identity function. We also experimented with manually setting a leaky ReLU. (This is in the Appendix)

[OPLU]
We have tested a norm-preserving activation function on the copy task and on the MNIST tasks. We found that it allows an RNN’s performance on the copy task to match that of an RNN without a nonlinearity. On MNIST, it allows all spectral margins to perform equally well. We discuss this further in the draft.

[MNIST with an orthogonal RNN + gain]
As suggested following the observation that the singular spectra tend toward distributions with mean 1.05 on the MNIST tasks, we trained an RNN with a transition matrix constrained to be purely orthogonal and applied a 1.05 gain on the hidden pre-activations. We found that this allowed purely orthogonal models to nearly match the top scores on these tasks instead of underperforming as they do without that gain.",,,
880,False,On orthogonality and learning recurrent networks with long term dependencies,"This paper investigates the impact of orthogonal weight matrices on learning dynamics in RNNs. The paper proposes a variety of interesting optimization formulations that enforce orthogonality in the recurrent weight matrix to varying degrees. The experimental results demonstrate several conclusions: enforcing exact orthogonality does not help learning, while enforcing soft orthogonality or initializing to orthogonal weights can substantially improve learning. While some of the optimization methods proposed currently require matrix inversion and are therefore slow in wall clock time, orthogonal initialization and some of the soft orthogonality constraints are relatively inexpensive and may find their way into practical use.

The experiments are generally done to a high standard and yield a variety of useful insights, and the writing is clear.

The experimental results are based on using a fixed learning rate for the different regularization strengths. Learning speed might be highly dependent on this, and different strengths may admit different maximal stable learning rates. It would be instructive to optimize the learning rate for each margin separately (maybe on one of the shorter sequence lengths) to see how soft orthogonality impacts the stability of the learning process. Fig. 5, for instance, shows that a sigmoid improves stability—but perhaps slightly reducing the learning rate for the non-sigmoid Gaussian prior RNN would make the learning well-behaved again for weightings less than 1.

Fig. 4 shows singular values converging around 1.05 rather than 1. Does initializing to orthogonal matrices multiplied by 1.05 confer any noticeable advantage over standard orthogonal matrices? Especially on the T=10K copy task?

“Curiously, larger margins and even models without sigmoidal constraints on the spectrum (no margin) performed well as long as they were initialized to be orthogonal suggesting that evolution away from orthogonality is not a serious problem on this task.” This is consistent with the analysis given in Saxe et al. 2013, where for deep linear nets, if a singular value is initialized to 1 but dies away during training, this is because it must be zero to implement the desired input-output map. More broadly, an open question has been whether orthogonality is useful as an initialization, as proposed by Saxe et al., where its role is mainly as a preconditioner which makes optimization proceed quickly but doesn’t fundamentally change the optimization problem; or whether it is useful as a regularizer, as proposed by Arjovsky et al. 2015 and Henaff et al. 2015, that is, as an additional constraint in the optimization problem (minimize loss subject to weights being orthogonal). These experiments seem to show that mere initialization to orthogonal weights is enough to reap an optimization speed advantage, and that too much regularization begins to hurt performance—i.e., substantially changing the optimization problem is undesirable. This point is also apparent in Fig. 2: In terms of the training loss on MNIST (Fig. 2), no margin does almost indistinguishably from a margin of 1 or .1. However in terms of accuracy, a margin of .1 is best. This shows that large or nonexistent margins (i.e., orthogonal initializations) enable fast optimization of the training loss, but among models that attain similar training loss, the more nearly orthogonal weights perform better. This starts to separate out the optimization speed advantage conferred by orthogonality from the regularization advantage it confers. It may be useful to more explicitly discuss the initialization vs regularization dimension in the text.

Overall, this paper contributes a variety of techniques and intuitions which are likely to be useful in training RNNs.
",,7.0,4.0
881,False,On orthogonality and learning recurrent networks with long term dependencies,"The paper is well-motivated, and is part of a line of recent work investigating the use of orthogonal weight matrices within recurrent neural networks. While using orthogonal weights addresses the issue of vanishing/exploding gradients, it is unclear whether anything is lost, either in representational power or in trainability, by enforcing orthogonality. As such, an empirical investigation that examines how these properties are affected by deviation from orthogonality is a useful contribution.

The paper is clearly written, and the primary formulation for investigating soft orthogonality constraints (representing the weight matrices in their SVD factorized form, which gives explicit control over the singular values) is clean and natural, albeit not necessarily ideal from a practical computational standpoint (as it requires maintaining multiple orthogonal weight matrices each requiring an expensive update step). I am unaware of this approach being investigated previously.

The experimental side, however, is somewhat lacking. The paper evaluates two tasks: a copy task, using an RNN architecture without transition non-linearities, and sequential/permuted sequential MNIST. These are reasonable choices for an initial evaluation, but are both toy problems and don't shed much light on the practical aspects of the proposed approaches. An evaluation in a more realistic setting would be valuable (e.g., a language modeling task).

Furthermore, while investigating pure RNN's makes sense for evaluating effects of orthogonality, it feels somewhat academic: LSTMs also provide a mechanism to capture longer-term dependencies, and in the tasks where the proposed approach was compared directly to an LSTM, it was significantly outperformed. It would be very interesting to see the effects of the proposed soft orthogonality constraint in additional architectures (e.g., deep feed-forward architectures, or whether there's any benefit when embedded within an LSTM, although this seems doubtful).

Overall, the paper addresses a clear-cut question with a well-motivated approach, and has interesting findings on some toy datasets. As such I think it could provide a valuable contribution.

The paper proposes a support regularized version of sparse coding that takes into account the underlying manifold structure of the data. For this purpose, the authors augment the classic sparse coding loss with a term that encourages near by points to have similar active set. Convergence guarantees for the optimization procedure are presented. Experimental evaluation on clustering and semi-supervised learning shows the benefits of the proposed approach.

The paper is well written and a nice read. The most relevant contribution of this work is to including (and optimizing) the regularization function, and not an approximation or surrogate. The authors derive a a PGD-styple iterative method and present convergence analysis for it. 

Thanks for the clarifications regarding the assumptions used in Section 3. It would be nice to include some of that in the manuscript.

The authors also propose a fast encoding scheme for their proposed method. 
The authors included a new experiment in semi-supervised consists of a very interesting use (of the method and the fast approximation). While this is an interesting addition, I think that using fast encoders is not particularly novel or the main part of the work. ""Converting"" iterative optimization algorithms into feed-forward nets for accelerating the inference process has been done in the past (several times with quite similar problems). Is natural that this can be done, and not very surprising. Maybe would be interesting to evaluate how important is to have an architecture matching the optimization algorithm, compared to a generic network (though some of this analysis has also been performed in the past).",,7.0,4.0
886,True,Support Regularized Sparse Coding and Its Fast Encoder,"The work proposes to use the geometry of data (that is considered to be known a priori) in order to have more consistent sparse coding. Namely, two data samples that are similar or neighbours, should have a sparse code that is similar (in terms of support). The general idea is not unique, but it is an interesting one (if one admits that the adjacency matrix A is known a priori), and the novelty mostly lies on the definition of the regularisation term that is an l1-norm (while other techniques would mostly use l2 regularisation).

Based on this idea, the authors develop a new SRSC algorithm, which is analysed in detail and shown to perform better than its competitors based on l2 sparse coding regularisation and other schemes in terms of clustering performance.

Inspired by LISTA, the authors then propose an approximate solution to the SRSC problem, called Deep-SRSC, that acts as a sort of fast encoder. Here too, the idea is interesting and seems to be quite efficient from experiments on USPS data, even if the framework seems to be strongly inspired from LISTA. That scheme should however be better motivated, by the limitations of SRSC that should be presented more clearly.

887,True,Support Regularized Sparse Coding and Its Fast Encoder,"
In this paper the authors propose a method to explicitly regularize sparse coding to encode neighbouring datapoints with similar sets of atoms from the dictionary by clustering training examples with KNN in input space. The resulting algorithm is relatively complex and computationally relatively expensive, but the authors provide detailed derivations and use arguments from proximal gradient descent methods to prove convergence (I did not follow all the derivations, only some). In general the paper is well written and the authors explain the motivation behind the algorithms design in detail. 

In the abstract the authors mention “extensive experimental results …”, but I find the experiments not very convincing: With experiments on the USPS handwritten digits dataset (why not MNIST?), COIL-20 and COIL-100 and UCI, the datasets are all relatively small and the algorithm is run with dictionary sizes between p=100 to p=500. This seems surprising because the authors state that they implemented SRSC in “CUDA C++ with extreme efficiency” (page 10). But more importantly, I find it hard to interpret and compare the results: The paper reports accuracy and and normalized mutual information for a image retrieval / clustering task where the proposed SRSC is used as a feature extractor. The improvements relative to standard Sparse Coding seem very small  (often < 1% in terms of NMI; it looks more promising in terms of accuracy) and if I understand the description on page 11 correctly, than the test set was used to select some hyperparameters (the best similarity measure for clustering step)? There is no comparisons to other baselines / state of the art image clustering methods.
Besides of providing features for a small scale image clustering system, are there maybe ways to more directly evaluate the properties and qualities of  a sparse coding approach? E.g. reconstruction error / sparsity; maybe even denoising performance?
 
In summary, I think in it current form the paper lacks the evaluation and experimental results for an ICLR publication. Intuitively, I agree with the authors that the proposed regularization is an interesting direction, but I don’t see experiments that directly show that the regularization has the desired effect; and the improvements in the clustering task where SRSC is used as a feature extractor are very modest.",,6.0,3.0

893,False,An Analysis of Feature Regularization for Low-shot Learning,"Summary
===
This paper extends and analyzes the gradient regularizer of Hariharan and
Girshick 2016. In that paper a regularizer was proposed which penalizes
gradient magnitudes and it was shown to aid low-shot learning performance.
This work shows that the previous regularizer is equivalent to a direct penalty
on the magnitude of feature values weighted differently per example.

The analysis goes to to provide two examples where a feature penalty
favors a better representation. The first example addresses the XOR
problem, constructing a network where a feature penalty encourages
a representation where XOR is linearly separable.
The second example analyzes a 2 layer linear network, showing improved stability
of a 2nd order optimizer when the feature penalty is added.
One last bit of analysis shows how this regularizer can be interpreted as
a Gaussian prior on both features and weights. Since the prior can be
interpreted as having a soft whitening effect, the feature regularizer
is like a soft version of Batch Normalization.

Experiments show small improvements on a synthetic XOR test set.
On the Omniglot dataset feature regularization is better than most baselines,
but is worse than Moment Matching Networks. An experiment on ImageNet similar
to Hariharan and Girshick 2016 also shows effective low-shot learning.


Strengths
===

* The core proposal is a simple modification of Hariharan and Girshick 2016.

* The idea of feature regularization is analyzed from multiple angles
both theoretically and empirically.

* The connection with Batch Normalization could have broader impact.


Weaknesses
===

* In section 2 the gradient regularizer of Hariharan and Girshick is introduced.
While introducing the concept, some concern is expressed about the motivation:
""And it is not very clear why small gradients on every sample produces
good generalization experimentally."" This seems to be the central issue to me.
The paper details some related analysis, it does not offer a clear answer to
this problem.


* The purpose and generality of section 2.1 is not clear.

The analysis provides a specific case (XOR with a non-standard architecture)
where feature regularization intuitively helps learn a better representation.
However, the intended take-away is not clear.

The take-away may be that since a feature penalty helps in this case it
should help in other cases. I am hesitant to buy that argument because of the
specific architecture used in this section. The result seems to rely on the
choice of an x^2 non-linearity, which is not often encountered in recent neural
net literature.

The point might also be to highlight the difference between a weight
penalty and a feature penalty because the two seem to encourage
different values of b in this case. However, there is no comparison to
a weight penalty on b in section 2.1.


* As far as I can tell, eq. 3 depends on either assuming an L2 or cross-entropy
loss. A more general class of losses for which eq. 3 holds is not provided. This
should be made clear before eq. 3 is presented.


* The Omniglot and ImageNet experiments are performed with Batch Normalization,
yet the paper points out that feature regularization may be similar in effect
to Batch Norm. Since the ResNet CNN baseline includes Batch Norm and there are
clear improvements over that baseline, the proposed regularizer has a clear
additional positive effect. However, results should be provided without
Batch Norm so a 1-1 comparison between the two methods can be performed.


* The ImageNet experiment should be more like Hariharan and Girshick.
In particular, the same split of classes should be used (provided in
the appendix) and performance should be measured using n > 1 novel examples
per class (using k nearest neighbors).


Minor:

* A brief comparison to Matching Networks is provided in section 3.2, but the
performance of Matching Networks should also be reported in Table 1.

* From the approach section: ""Intuitively when close to convergence, about half
of the data-cases recommend to update a parameter to go left, while
the other half recommend to go right.""

Could the intuition be clarified? There are many directions in high
dimensional space and many ways to divide them into two groups.

* Is the SGM penalty of Hariharan and Girshick implemented for this paper
or using their code? Either is acceptable, but clarification would be appreciated.

* Should the first equal sign in eq. 13 be proportional to, not equal to?

* The work is dense in nature, but I think the presentation could be improved.
In particular, more detailed derivations could be provided in an appendix
and some details could be removed from the main version in order to increase
focus on the results (e.g., the derviation in section 2.2.1).


Overall Evaluation
===

This paper provides an interesting set of analyses, but their value is not clear.
There is no clear reason why a gradient or feature regularizer should improve
low-shot learning performance. Despite that, experiments support that conclusion,
the analysis is interesting by itself, and the analysis may help lead to a
clearer explanation.

Finally, they demonstrate experimentally that such a regularization improves performance on low-shot tasks.

First, this is a nice analysis of some simple models, and proposes interesting insights in some optimization issues. Unfortunately, the authors do not demonstrate, nor argue in a convincing manner, that such an analysis extends to deep non-linear computation structures. I feel like the authors could write a full paper about ""results can be derived for φ(x) with convex differentiable non-linear activation functions such as ReLU"", both via analysis and experimentation to measure numerical stability.

Second, the authors again show an interesting correspondance to batch normalization, but IMO fail to experimentally show its relevance.

Finally, I understand the appeal of the proposed method from a numerical stability point of view, but am not convinced that it has any effect on low-shot learning in the high dimensional spaces that deep networks are used for.

I commend the authors for contributing to the mathematical understanding of our field, but I think they have yet to demonstrate the large scale effectiveness of what they propose. At the same time, I feel like this paper does not have a clear and strong message. It makes various (interesting) claims about a number of things, but they seem more or less disparate, and only loosely related to low-shot learning.

901,False,A Joint Many-Task Model: Growing a Neural Network for Multiple NLP Tasks,"The paper introduce a way to train joint models for many NLP tasks. Traditionally, we treat these tasks as “pipeline” — the later tasks will depending on the output of the previous tasks. Here, the authors propose a neural approach which includes all the tasks in one single model. The higher level tasks takes (1) the predictions from the lower level tasks and (2) the hidden representations of the lower level tasks. Also proposed in this paper, is the successive regularization. Intuitively, this means that, when training the high level tasks, we don’t want to change the model in the lower levels by too much so that the lower level tasks can keep a reasonable accuracy of prediction.

On the modeling side, I think the proposed model is very similar comparing to (Zhang and Weiss, ACL 2016) and SPINN (Bowman et al, 2016) in a even simpler way. The number of the experiments are good. But I am not sure I am convinced by the numbers in Table 1 since the patterns are not very clear there — sometimes, the performance of the higher level tasks even goes down when training with more tasks (sometimes it does go up, but also not very significant and stable). The dependency scores, although I don’t think this is a serious problem, comparing the UAS/LAS when the output is not guaranteed to be a well-formed tree isn’t strictly speaking fair.

I admit that the successive regularization make sense intuitively and is a very interesting direction to try. However, without a careful study of the training schema of such model, the current results on successive regularization do not convince me that it should be the right thing to do in such models (the current results are not strong enough to show that).

However, the novelty is relatively incremental given previous cited work on multi-stream networks, and it is not clear that this particular decoupling works well or is of broader interest beyond the specific task of future frame prediction.

While results on KTH and Weizmann are convincing and significantly outperform baselines, the results are less impressive on less constrained UCF-101 dataset.  The qualitative examples for UCF-101 are not convincing, as discussed in the pre-review question.

903,False,Reference-Aware Language Models,"This paper introduces pointer-network neural networks, which are applied to referring expressions in three small-scale language modeling tasks: dialogue modeling, recipe modeling and news article modeling. When conditioned on the co-reference chain, the proposed models outperform standard sequence-to-sequence models with attention.

The proposed models are essentially variants of pointer networks with copy mechanisms (Gulcehre et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016; Ling et al., 2016), which have been modified to take into account reference chains. As such, the main architectural novelty lies in 1) restricting the pointer mechanism to focus on co-referenced entities, 2) applying pointer mechanism to 2D arrays (tables), and 3) training with supervised alignments. Although useful in practice, these are minor contributions from an architectural perspective.

The empirical contributions are centred around measuring perplexity on the three language modeling tasks. Measuring perplexity is typical for standard language modeling tasks, but is really an unreliable proxy for dialogue modeling and recipe generation performance. In addition to this, both the dialogue and recipe tasks are tiny compared to standard language modeling tasks. This makes it difficult to evaluate the impact of the dialogue and recipe modeling results. For example, if one was to bootstrap from a larger corpus, it seems likely that a standard sequence-to-sequence model with attention would yield performance comparable to the proposed models (with enough data, the attention mechanism could learn to align referring entities by itself). The language modeling task on news article (Gigaword) seems to yield the most conclusive results. However, the dataset for this task is non-standard and results are provided for only a single baseline. Overall, this limits the conclusions we can draw from the empirical experiments.

904,False,Reference-Aware Language Models,"This paper presents a new type of language model that treats entity references as latent variables. The paper is structured as three specialized models for three applications: dialog generation with references to database entries, recipe generation with references to ingredients, and text generation with coreference mentions.

Despite some opaqueness in details that I will discuss later, the paper does a great job making the main idea coming through, which I think is quite interesting and definitely worth pursuing further. But it seems the paper was rushed into the deadline, as there are a few major weaknesses.

The first major weakness is that the claimed latent variables are hardly latent in the actual empirical evaluation. As clarified by the authors via pre-review QAs, all mentions were assumed to be given to all model variants, and so, it would seem like an over-claim to call these variables as latent when they are in fact treated as observed variables. Is it because the models with latent variables were too difficult to train right?

A related problem is the use of perplexity as an evaluation measure when comparing reference-aware language models to vanilla language models. Essentially the authors are comparing two language models defined over different event space, which is not a fair comparison. Because mentions were assumed to be given for the reference-aware language models, and because of the fact that mention generators are designed similar to a pointer network, the probability scores over mentions will naturally be higher, compared to the regular language model that needs to consider a much bigger vocabulary set. The effect is analogous to comparing language models with aggressive UNK (and a small vocabulary set) to a language models with no UNK (and a much larger vocabulary set).

To mitigate this problem, the authors need to perform one of the following additional evaluations: either assuming no mention boundaries and marginalizing over all possibilities (treating latent variables as truly latent), or showing other types of evaluation beyond perplexity, for example, BLEU, METEOR, human evaluation etc on the corresponding generation task.

The other major weakness is writing in terms of technical accuracy and completeness. I found many details opaque and confusing even after QAs. I wonder if the main challenge that hinders the quality of writing has something to do with having three very specialized models in one paper, each having a lot of details to be worked out, which may have not been extremely important for the main story of the paper, but nonetheless not negligible in order to understand what is going on with the paper.    Perhaps the authors can restructure the paper so that the most important details are clearly worked out in the main body of the paper, especially in terms of latent variable handling — how to make mention detection and conference resolution truly latent, and if and when entity update helps, which in the current version is not elaborated at all, as it is mentioned only very briefly for the third application (coreference resolution) without any empirical comparisons to motivate the update operation.

905,False,Reference-Aware Language Models,"This paper explores 3 language modeling applications with an explicit modeling of reference expressions: dialog, receipt generation and coreferences.

1. This paper is not clearly written and is pretty hard to follow some details. In particular,  there are many obvious math errors, such as missing the marginalization sum in Eq (1), and P(z_{i,v}...) = 1 (should be 0 here) on page 5, pointer switch section.

The paper also explores predicting custom floating-point precision parameters directly from the neural network activations, avoiding exhaustive search, but i could not follow this part. Only the activations of the last layer are evaluated, but on what data ? On all the validation set ? Why would this be faster than computing the classification accuracy ?

The results should be useful for hardware manufacturers, but with a catch. All popular convolutional networks now use batch normalization, while none of the evaluated ones do. It may well be that the conclusions of this study will be completely different on batch normalization networks, and fixed-point representations are best there, but that remains to be seen. It seems like something worth exploring.

Several standard computer vision architectures including VGG and GoogleNet are considered for the experiments, and it is concluded that floating point representations are preferred over fixed point representations, and floating point numbers with about 14 bits are sufficient for the considered architectures resulting in a small loss in accuracy.

The paper provides a nice overview of floating and fixed point representations and focuses on an important aspect of deep learning that is not well studied. There are several aspects of the paper that could be improved, but overall, I am leaned toward weak accept assuming that the authors address the issues below.

1- The paper is not clear that it is only focusing on neural network inference. Please include the word ""inference"" in the title / abstract to clarify this point and mention that the findings of the paper do not necessarily apply to neural network training as training dynamics could be different.

2- The paper does not discuss the possibility of adopting quantization tricks during training, which may result in the use of fewer bits at inference.

Also, how accurate are these numbers given different possible designs and the potential difference between simulation and production? Please elaborate on the details of simulation in the paper.

4- The whole discussion about ""efficient customized precision search"" seem unimportant to me. When such important hardware considerations are concerned, even spending 20x simulation time is not that important. The exhaustive search process could be easily parallelized and one may rather spend more time at simulation at the cost of finding the exact best configuration rather than an approximation. That said, weak configurations could be easily filtered after evaluating just a few examples.

5- Nvidia's Pascal GP100 GPU supports FP16. This should be discussed in the paper and relevant Nvidia papers / documents should be cited.

908,False,Rethinking Numerical Representations for Deep Neural Networks,"This paper explores the performance-area-energy-model accuracy tradeoff encountered in designing custom number representations for deep learning inference. Common image-based benchmarks: VGG, Googlenet etc are used to demonstrate that fewer than1 6 bits in a custom floating point representation can lead to improvement in runtime performance and energy efficiency with only a small loss in model accuracy.

Questions:

1. Does the custom floating point number representation take into account support for de-normal numbers? 
2. Is the custom floating point unit clocked at the same frequency as the baseline 32-bit floating point unit? If not, what are the different frequencies used and how would this impact the overall system design in terms of feeding the data to the floating point units from the memory

Comments:

1. I would recommend using the IEEE half-precision floating point (1bit sign, 5bit exponent, and 10bit mantissa) as a baseline for comparison. At this point, it is well known in both the ML and the HW communities that 32-bit floats are an overkill for DNN inference and major HW vendors already include support for IEEE half-precision floats. 
2. In my opinion, the claim that switching to custom floating point  lead to a YY.ZZ x savings in energy is misleading. It might be true that the floating-point unit itself might consume less energy due to smaller bit-width of the operands, however a large fraction of the total energy is spent in data movement to/from the memories. As a result, reducing the floating point unit’s energy consumption by a certain factor will not translate to the same reduction in the total energy. A reader not familiar with such nuances (for example a typical member of the ML community), may be mislead by such claims. 
3. On a similar note as comment 2, the authors should explicitly mention that the claimed speedup is that of the floating point unit only, and it will not translate to the overall workload speedup. Although the speedup of the compute unit is roughly quadratic in the bit-width, the bandwidth requirements scale linearly with bit-width. As a result, it is possible that these custom floating point units may be starved on memory bandwidth, in which case the claims of speedup and energy savings need to be revisited.
4. The authors should also comment on the complexities and overheads introduced in data accesses, designing the various system buses/ data paths when the number representation is not byte-aligned. Moving to a custom 14-bit number representation (for example) can improve the performance and energy-efficiency of the floating point unit, but these gains can be partially eroded due to the additional overhead in supporting non-byte aligned memory accesses.

909,False,Epitomic Variational Autoencoders,"This paper is refreshing and elegant in its handling of ""over-sampling"" in VAE. Problem is that good reconstruction requires more nodes in the latent layers of the VAE. Not all of them can or should be sampled from at the ""creative"" regime of the VAE. Which ones to choose? The paper offers and sensible solution. Problem is that real-life data-sets like CIFAR have not being tried, so the reader is hard-pressed to choose between many other, just as natural, solutions. One can e.g. run in parallel a classifier and let it choose the best epitome, in the spirit of spatial transformers, ACE, reference [1]. The list can go on.

On a secondary note, regarding terminology: Pls avoid using ""the KL term"" as in section 2.1, there are so many ""KL terms"" related to VAE-s, it ultimately gets out of control. ""Generative error"" is a more descriptive term, because minimizing it is indispensable for the generative qualities of the net. The variational error for example is also a ""KL term"" (equation (3.4) in reference [1]), as is the upper bound commonly used in VAE-s (your formula (5) and its equivalent - the KL expression as in formula (3.8) in reference [1]).

910,False,Epitomic Variational Autoencoders,"This paper replaces the Gaussian prior often used in a VAE with a group sparse prior. They modify the approximate posterior function so that it also generates group sparse samples. The development of novel forms for the generative model and inference process in VAEs is an active and important area of research. I don't believe the specific choice of prior proposed in this paper is very well motivated however. I believe several of the conceptual claims are incorrect. The experimental results are unconvincing, and I suspect compare log likelihoods in bits against competing algorithms in nats.

Some more detailed comments:

In Table 1, the log likelihoods reported for competing techniques are all in nats. The reported log likelihood of cVAE using 10K samples is not only higher than the likelihood of true data samples, but is also higher than the log likelihood that can be achieved by fitting a 10K k-means mixture model to the data (eg as done in ""A note on the evaluation of generative models""). It should nearly impossible to outperform a 10K k-means mixture on Parzen estimation, which makes me extremely skeptical of these eVAE results. However, if you assume that the eVAE log likelihood is actually in bits, and multiply it by log 2 to convert to nats, then it corresponds to a totally believable log likelihood. Note that some Parzen window implementations report log likelihood in bits. Is this experiment comparing log likelihood in bits to competing log likelihoods in nats? (also, label units -- eg bits or nats -- in table)

It would be really, really, good to report and compare the variational lower bound on the log likelihood!! Alternatively, if you are concerned your bound is loose, you can use AIS to get a more exact measure of the log likelihood. Even if the Parzen window results are correct, Parzen estimates of log likelihood are extremely poor. They possess any drawback of log likelihood evaluation (which they approximate), and then have many additional drawbacks as well.

The MNIST sample quality does not appear to be visually competitive. Also -- it appears that the images are of the probability of activation for each pixel, rather than actual samples from the model. Samples would be more accurate, but either way make sure to describe what is shown in the figure.

There are no experiments on non-toy datasets.

I am still concerned about most of the issues I raised in my questions below. Briefly, some comments on the authors' response:

1. ""minibatches are constructed to not only have a random subset of training examples but also be balanced w.r.t. to epitome assignment (Alg. 1, ln. 4).""
Nice! This makes me feel better about why all the epitomes will be used.

2. I don't think your response addresses why C_vae would trade off between data reconstruction and being factorial. The approximate posterior is factorial by construction -- there's nothing in C_vae that can make it more or less factorial.

3. ""For C_vae to have zero contribution from the KL term of a particular z_d (in other words, that unit is deactivated), it has to have all the examples in the training set be deactivated (KL term of zero) for that unit""
This isn't true. A standard VAE can set the variance to 1 and the mean to 0 (KL term of 0) for some examples in the training set, and have non-zero KL for other training examples.

4. The VAE loss is trained on a lower bound on the log likelihood, though it does have a term that looks like reconstruction error. Naively, I would imagine that if it overfits, this would correspond to data samples becoming more likely under the generative model.

5/6. See Parzen concerns above. It's strange to train a binary model, and then treat it's probability of activation as a sample in a continuous space.

6. ""we can only evaluate the model from its samples""
I don't believe this is true. You are training on a lower bound on the log likelihood, which immediately provides another method of quantitative evaluation. Additionally, you could use techniques such as AIS to compute the exact log likelihood.

911,False,Epitomic Variational Autoencoders,"This paper proposes an elegant solution to a very important problem in VAEs, namely that the model over-regularizes itself by killing off latent dimensions. People have used annealing of the KL term and “free bits” to hack around this issue but a better solution is needed.
The offered solution is to introduce sparsity for the latent representation: for every input only a few latent distributions will be activated but across the dataset many latents can still be learned. 
What I didn’t understand is why the authors need the topology in this latent representation. Why not place a prior over arbitrary subsets of latents? That seems to increase the representational power a lot without compromising the solution to the problem you are trying to solve. Now the number of ways the latents can combine is no longer exponentially large, which seems a pity. 
The first paragraph on p.7 is a mystery to me: “An effect of this …samples”. How can under-utilization of model capacity lead to overfitting?

The focus of the paper is mainly on how to model the relationship between question and the answer spans. The idea proposed by this paper is reasonable, but not ground breaking. The analysis is interesting and potentially useful. I would hope the authors can go extra miles to analyze different choices of boundary prediction models and make a more convincing case for the necessity of modeling the score of the span globally.

The main idea behind RASOR is to globally normalize and rank the scores of the possible answer spans. RASOR is able to achieve this by first modeling the hidden vectors of all words with LSTMs. Then, the representation of a text span is formed by concatenating the corresponding hidden vectors of the start and the end word of the corresponding chunk. The approach is reasonable, but not earth shattering. Also, the table 6 shows that the improvement over end-prediction point is not very large.

I appreciate the fact that authors conduct several analysis experiments as some of them are quite interesting. For example, it seems that question independent representation is also very import to the performance. In addition to the current analysis, I also want to get a clear idea on what makes the current model be better than the Match-LSTM. Is it hyper-parameter tuning?

This is an important contribution, with several good applications.  The main insight is to use adversarial training to learn a policy that is robust to this difference in perspective.  This problem formulation is quite novel compared to the standard imitation learning literature (usually first-order perspective), though has close links to the literature on transfer learning (as explained in Sec.2).

The basic approach is clearly explained, and follows quite readily from recent literature on imitation learning and adversarial training.

I would have expected to see comparison to the following methods added to Figure 3:
1)  Standard 1st person imitation learning using agent A data, and apply the policy on agent A.  This is an upper-bound on how well you can expect to do, since you have the correct perspective.
2)  Standard 1st person imitation learning using agent A data, then apply the policy on agent B.  Here, I expect it might do less well than 3rd person learning, but worth checking to be sure, and showing what is the gap in performance.
3)  Reinforcement learning using agent A data, and apply the policy on agent A.  I expect this might do better than 3rd person imitation learning but it might depend on the scenario (e.g. difficulty of imitation vs exploration; how different are the points of view between the agents). I understand this is how the expert data is collected for the demonstrator, but I don’t see the performance results from just using this procedure on the learner (to compare to Fig.3 results).

Including these results would in my view significantly enhance the impact of the paper.",,6.0,4.0
916,True,Third Person Imitation Learning,"This paper proposed a novel adversarial framework to train a model from demonstrations in a third-person perspective, to perform the task in the first-person view. Here the adversarial training is used to extract a novice-expert (or third-person/first-person) independent feature so that the agent can use to perform the same policy in a different view point.

While the idea is quite elegant and novel (I enjoy reading it), more experiments are needed to justify the approach. Probably the most important issue is that there is no baseline, e.g., what if we train the model with the image from the same viewpoint? It should be better than the proposed approach but how close are they? How the performance changes when we gradually change the viewpoint from third-person to first-person? Another important question is that maybe the network just blindly remembers the policy, in this case, the extracted feature could be artifacts of the input image that implicitly counts the time tick in some way (and thus domain-agonistic), but can still perform reasonable policy. Since the experiments are conduct in a synthetic environment, this might happen. An easy check is to run the algorithm on multiple viewpoint and/or with blurred/differently rendered images, and/or with random initial conditions.

Other ablation analysis is also needed. For example, I am not fully convinced by the gradient flipping trick used in Eqn. 5, and in the experiments there is no ablation analysis for that (GAN/EM style training versus gradient flipping trick). For the experiments, Fig. 4,5,6 does not have error bars and is not very convincing.",,5.0,3.0
917,True,Third Person Imitation Learning,"The paper presents an interesting new problem setup for imitation learning: an agent tries to imitate a trajectory demonstrated by an expert but said trajectory is demonstrated in a different state or observation space than the one accessible by the agent (although the dynamics of the underlying MDP are shared). The paper proposes a solution strategy that combines recent work on domain confusion losses with a recent IRL method based on generative adversarial networks.

I believe the general problem to be relevant and agree with the authors that it results in a more natural formulation for imitation learning that might be more widely applicable.
There are however a few issues with the paper in its current state that make the paper fall short of being a great exploration of a novel idea. I will list these concerns in the following (in arbitrary order)
- The paper feels at times to be a bit hurriedly written (this also mainly manifests itself in the experiments, see comment below) and makes a few fairly strong claims in the introduction that in my opinion are not backed up by their approach. For example: ""Advancements in this class of algorithms would significantly improve the state of robotics, because it will enable anyone to easily teach robots new skills""; given that the current method to my understanding has the same issues that come with standard GAN training (e.g. instability etc.) and requires a very accurate simulator to work well (since TRPO will require a large number of simulated trajectories in each step) this seems like an overstatement.
  There are some sentences that are ungrammatical or switch tense in the middle of the sentence making the paper harder to read than necessary, e.g. Page 2: ""we find that this simple approach has been able to solve the problems""
- The general idea of third person imitation learning is nice, clear and (at least to my understanding) also novel. However, instead of exploring how to generally adapt current IRL algorithms to this setting the authors pick a specific approach that they find promising (using GANs for IRL) and extend it. A significant amount of time is then spent on explaining why current IRL algorithms will fail in the third-person setting. I fail to see why the situation for the GAN based approach is any different than that of any other existing IRL algorithm. To be more clear: I see no reason why e.g. behavioral cloning could not be extended with a domain confusion loss in exactly the same way as the approach presented. To this end it would have been nice to rather discuss which algorithms can be adapted in the same way (and also test them) and which ones cannot. One straightforward approach to apply any IRL algorithm would for example be to train two autoencoders for both domains that share higher layers + a domain confusion loss on the highest layer, should that not result in features that are directly usable? If not, why?
- While the general argument that existing IRL algorithms will fail in the proposed setting seems reasonable it is still unfortunate that no attempts have been made to validate this empirically. No comparison is made regarding what happens when one e.g. performs supervised learning (behavioral cloning) using the expert observations and then transfers to the changed domain. How well would this work in practice ? Also, how fast can different IRL algorithms solve the target task in general (assuming a first person perspective) ?
- Although I like the idea of presenting the experiments as being directed towards answering a specific set of questions I feel like the posed questions somewhat distract from the main theme of the paper. Question 2 suddenly makes the use of additional velocity information to be a main point of importance and the experiments regarding Question 3 in the end only contain evaluations regarding two hyperparameters (ignoring all other parameters such as the parameters for TRPO, the number of rollouts per iteration, the number of presented expert episodes and  the design choices for the GAN). I understand that not all of these can be evaluated thoroughly in a conference paper but I feel like some more experiments or at least some discussion would have helped here.
- The presented experimental evaluation somewhat hides the cost of TRPO training with the obtained reward function. How many roll-outs are necessary in each step?
- The experiments lack some details: How are the expert trajectories obtained? The domains for the pendulum experiment seem identical except for coloring of the pole, is that correct (I am surprised this small change seems to have such a detrimental effect)? Figure 3 shows average performance over 5 trials, what about Figure 5 (if this is also average performance, what is the variance here)? Given that GANs are not easy to train, how often does the training fail/were you able to re-use the hyperparameters across all experiments?

I updated the score. Please see my response to the rebuttal below.
",,6.0,4.0
918,False,The Variational Walkback Algorithm,"This paper proposes a new kind of generative model based on an annealing process, where the transition probabilities are learned directly to maximize a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood. Overall, the idea is clever and appealing, but I think the paper needs more quantitative validation and better discussion of the relationship with prior work.

In terms of prior work, AIS and RAISE are both closely related algorithms, and share much of the mathematical structure with the proposed method. For this reason, it’s not sufficient to mention them in passing in the related work section; those methods and their relationship to variational walkback need to be discussed in detail. If I understand correctly, the proposed method is essentially an extension of RAISE where the transition probabilities are learned rather than fixed based on an existing MRF. I think this is an interesting and worthwhile extension, but the relationship to existing work needs to be clarified.

The analysis of Appendix D seems incorrect. It derives a formula for the ratios of prior and posterior probabilities, but this formula only holds under the assumption of constant temperature (in which case the ratio is very large). When the temperature is varied, the analysis of Neal (2001) applies, and the answer is different. 

One of the main selling points of the method is that it optimizes a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood; even more accurate estimates can be obtained using importance sampling. It ought to be easy to report log-likelihood estimates for this method, so I wonder why such estimates aren’t reported. There are lots of prior results to compare against on MNIST. (In addition, a natural baseline would be RAISE, so that one can check if the ability to learn the transitions actually helps.)

I think the basic idea here is a sound one, so I would be willing to raise my score if the above issues are addressed in a revised version.


Minor comments:

“A recognized obstacle to training undirected graphical models… is that ML training requires sampling from MCMC chains in the inner loop of training, for each example.” This seems like an unfair characterization, since the standard algorithm is PCD, which usually takes only a single step per mini-batch.

Some of the methods discussed in the related work are missing citations.

The method is justified in terms of “carving the energy function in the right direction at each point”, but I’m not sure this is actually what’s happening. Isn’t the point of the method that it can optimize a lower bound on the log-likelihood, and therefore learn a globally correct allocation of probability mass?",,4.0,5.0
919,False,The Variational Walkback Algorithm,"The authors present a method for training probabilistic models by maximizing a stochastic variational-lower-bound-type objective. Training involves sampling and then learning a transition-based inference to ""walk back"" samples to the data. Because of its focus on transitions, it can be used to learn a raw transition operator rather than purely learning an energy-based model. The objective is intuitively appealing because of its similarity to previous successful but less principled training methods for MRFs like Contrastive Divergence.

The idea for the algorithm is appealing, and it looks like it could find a nice place in the literature. However, the submission in its current form is not yet ready for publication. Experiments are qualitative and the generated samples are not obviously indicative of a high model quality. As pointed out elsewhere, the mathematical analysis does not currently demonstrate tightness of the variational bound in the case of a learned transition operator. More evaluation using e.g. annealed importance sampling to estimate held-out likelihoods is necessary. Assuming that the analysis can be repaired, the ability to directly parametrize a transition operator, an interesting strength of this method, should be explored in further experiments and contrasted with the more standard energy-based modeling.

This looks like a promising idea, and other reviews and questions have already raised some important technical points which should help strengthen this paper for future submission.",,4.0,4.0
920,False,The Variational Walkback Algorithm,"I very much like the underlying idea for this paper. I wasn't convinced by the execution in its current state. My primary concern is the one I expressed in my pre-review question below, which I don't think the authors addressed. Specifically, I think the choice of q(s | s') = p(s | s') will make the forward and reverse trajectories almost pathologically mismatched to each other, and will thus make the variational bound extremely loose and high variance. 

The claim about the tightness of the bound in Appendix D relies on the assumption that the transition distribution obeys detailed balance. The learned transition distribution in the paper does not obey detailed balance, and therefore the tightness claim in Appendix D does not hold. (In Section 2.1 you briefly discuss the idea of learning an energy function, rather than directly learning a transition distribution. I think this would be excellent, and in that case you could choose an MCMC transition operator that does obey detailed balance for that energy function.) I did not go through Appendix D beyond this step.

The experimental results were not visually impressive. I suspect this is primarily driven by the mismatch between generative and inference trajectories. See my concern above and in the pre-review question below.

Also, see note below for sec. 5. I suspect some terms are being dropped from the training gradient.

The paper is optimizing a variational bound on log likelihood. You should really, really, really report and compare log likelihoods against competing methods!

921,True,Learning Recurrent Representations for Hierarchical Behavior Modeling,"This paper proposes a recurrent architecture for simultaneously predicting motion and action states of agents.
The paper is well written, clear in its presentation and backed up by good experiments.
They demonstrate that by forcing the network to predict motion has beneficial consequences on the classification of actions states,
allowing more accurate classification with less training data.
They also show how the information learned by the network is interpretable and organised in a hierarchy.

Weaknesses:
- a critical discussion on the interplay between motion an behaviour that is needed to experience the benefits of their proposed model is missing from the paper.
- moreover, a discussion on how this approach could scale to more challenging scenarios ""involving animals"" and visual input for instance and more general ""behaviours"" is also missing;
The criticism here is pointed at the fact that the title/abstract claim general behaviour modelling, whilst the experiments are focused on two very specific and relatively simple scenarios,

The overall approach is interesting: all three of the key techniques (aux. tasks, skip/diagonal connections, and the use of internal labels for the kind of data available) make a lot of sense.

I found some of the results hard to understand/interpret. Some of the explanation in the discussion below has been helpful (e.g. see my earlier questions about Fig 4 and 5); the paper would benefit from including more such explanations. 

It may be worthwhile very briefly mentioning the relationship of ""diagonal"" connections to other emerging terms for similar ideas (e.g. skip connections, etc). ""Skip"" seems to me to be accurate regardless of how you draw the network, whereas ""diagonal"" only makes sense for certain visual layouts.

In response to comment in the discussion below: ""leading to less over-segmentation of action bouts"" (and corresponding discussion in section 5.1 of the paper): I would be like to have a bit more about this in the paper. I have assumed that ""per-bout"" refers to ""per-action event"", but now I am not certain that I have understood this correctly (i.e. can a ""bout"" last for a few minutes?): given the readership, I think it would not be inappropriate to define some of these things explicitly.

In response to comment about fly behaviours that last minutes vs milliseconds: This is interesting, and I would be curious to know how classification accuracy relates to the time-scale of the behaviour (e.g. are most of the mistakes on long-term behaviours? i realize that this would only tell part of the story, e.g. if you have a behaviour that has both a long-term duration, but that also has very different short-term characteristics than many other behaviours, it should be easy to classify accuractely despite being ""long-term""). If easy to investigate this, I would add a comment about it; if this is hard to investigate, it's probably not worth it at this point, although it's something you might want to look at in future.

In response to comment about scaling to human behavior: I agree that in principle, adding conv layers directly above the sensory input would be the right thing to try, but seriously: there is usually a pretty big gap between what ""should"" work and what actually works, as I am sure the authors are aware. (Indeed, I am sure the authors have a much more experiential and detailed understanding of the limitations of their work than I do). What I see presented is a nice system that has been demonstrated to handle spatiotemporal trajectories. The claims made should correspond to this.

923,True,Learning Recurrent Representations for Hierarchical Behavior Modeling,"The paper presents a method for joint motion prediction and activity classification from sequences with two different applications: motion of fruit flies and online handwriting recognition.

The method uses a classical encoder-decoder pipeline, with skip connections allowing direct communication between the encoder and the decoder on respective levels of abstraction.
Motion is discretized and predicted using classification. The model is trained on classification loss combined with a loss on motion prediction. The goal is to leverage latter loss in a semi-supervised setting from parts of the data which do not contain action labels.

The idea of leveraging predictions to train feature representations for discrimination is not new. However, the paper presents a couple of interesting ideas, partially inspired from other work in other areas.

My biggest concern is with the experimental evaluation. The experimental section contains a large amount of figures, which visualize what the model has learned in a qualitative way. However, quantitative evaluation is rarer.

- On the fly application, the authors compare the classification performance with another method previously published by the first author.

926,False,Divide and Conquer with Neural Networks,"The basic idea of this contribution is very nice and worth pursuing: how to use the powerful “divide and conquer” algorithm design strategy to learn better programs for tasks such as sorting or planar convex hull. However, the execution of this idea is not convincing and needs polishing before acceptance. As it is right now, the paper has a proof-of-concept feel that makes it great for a workshop contribution.

My main concern is that the method presented is currently not easily applicable to other tasks. Typically, demonstrations of program induction from input-output examples on well known tasks serves the purpose of proving, that a generic learning machine is able to solve some well known tasks, and will be useful on other tasks due to its generality. This contribution, however, presents a learning machine that is very hand-tailored to the two chosen tasks. The paper essentially demonstrates that with enough engineering (hardcoding the recurrency structure, designing problem-specific rules of supervision at lower recurrency levels) one can get a partially trainable sorter or convex hull solver.

I found the contribution relatively hard to understand. High level ideas are mixed with low-level tricks required to get the model to work and it is not clear either how the models operate, nor how much of them was actually learned, and how much was designed. The answer to the questions did hep, nut didn't make it into the paper. Mixing the descriptions of the tricks required to solve the two tasks makes things even more confusing.

1. Incorrect claims about related work affecting novelty:

  - This work is not the first to explore a deep learning approach to automatic code completion: “Toward Deep Learning Software Repositories”, MSR’15 also uses deep learning for code completion, and is not cited.

  - “Code Completion with Statistical Language Models”, PLDI’14 is cited incorrectly -- it also does code completion with recurrent neural networks.

  - PHOG is independent of JavaScript -- it does representation learning and has been applied to other languages (e.g., Python, see OOPSLA’16 below). 

  - This submission is not the only one that “can automatically extract features”. Some high-precision (cited) baselines do it.

  - “Structured generative models of natural source code” is an incorrect citation. It is from ICML’14 and has more authors. It is also a log-linear model and conditions on more context than claimed in this submission.


2. Uses a non-comparable prediction task for non-terminal symbols: The type of prediction made here is simpler than the one used in PHOG and state-of-the-art (see OOPSLA’16 paper below) and thus the claimed 11 point improvement is not substantiated. In particular, in JavaScript there are 44 types of nodes. However, a PHOG and OOPSLA’16 predictions considers not only these 44 types, but also whether there are right siblings and children of a node. This is necessary for predicting tree fragments instead of a sequence of nodes. It however makes the prediction harder than the one considered here (it leads to 150+ labels, a >3x increase).

Still, simply augmenting previous work with LSTM-based conditioning is not enough of a contribution to justify an entire paper. Some directions that would greatly improve the contribution include: considering distinct traversal orders, does this change the predictive accuracy? Any other ways of dealing with UNK tokens? The ultimate goal of this paper is to improve code completion, and it would be great to go beyond simply neurifying previous methods.

The models described in Bielik et al. 2016 and Maddison & Tarlow 2014 can in principle condition on any part of the AST already generated. The difference in this work is that the LSTM can learn to condition in a flexible way that doesn't increase the complexity of the computation.

- In the denying prediction experiments, the most interesting number is the Prediction Accuracy, which is P(accurate | model doesn't predict UNK).

Another minor tweak is the option to ""deny prediction,"" which makes sense in the context of code completion in an IDE, as it's probably better to not make a prediction if the model is very unsure about what comes next.

Empirically, results show that performance is worse than previous work on predicting terminals but better at predicting nonterminals. However, I find the split between terminals and nonterminals to be strange, and it's not clear to me what the takeaway is. Surely a simple proxy for what we care about is how often the system is going to suggest the next token that actually appears in the code. Why not compute this and report a single number to summarize the performance?

The proposed histogram filter is a particular Bayesian filter that represents the discretized states using beliefs. The prediction step is parameterized by a locally linear and translation-invariant motion model while the measurement model is represented by a multi-layered neural network. The whole system is learned with both supervised and unsupervised objectives and experiments are carried out on two synthetic robot localization tasks (1D and 2D). The major claim of this paper is that the problem-specific model structure (Bayesian filter for state estimation) should improve pure deep learning approach in data-efficiency and generalization ability. 
+This paper has nice arguments about the importance of prior knowledge to deep learning approach for specific tasks. 
+An end-to-end histogram filter is derived for state estimation and unsupervised learning is possible in this model.
-This paper seems to have a hidden assumption that deep learning (RNN) is a natural choice for recursive state estimation and the rest of paper is built upon this assumption including LSTM baselines. However, this assumption itself may not be true, because Bayesian filter is a first-established approach for this classic problem, so it it more important to justify if deep learning is even necessary for solving the tasks presented. This requests pure Bayesian filter baselines in the experiments. 
-The derived histogram filter seems to be particularly designed for discretized state space. It is not clear how well it can be generalized to continuous state space using the notation ""x"". More interestingly, the observation is discrete (binary) as well, which eventually makes it possible to derive a closed-form measurement update model. This setup might be too constrained. Generalizing to continuous observations is not a trivial task, not even to mention using images as observations like Haarnoja et al 2016. These design choices overall narrow down the scope of applicability.",,4.0,3.0

Summary:
--------
The authors propose a histogram based state representation with differentiable motion models and observation updates for state tracking from observations. Linear model with Gaussian noise is used as the motion model, while a neural network is used to learn the measurement model. They track robot states in: (1) 1-D hallway, and (2) a 2D arena.


Positives:
----------
1. Show how to encode prior knowledge about state-transitions in the architecture.
2. No assumptions about the observation model, which is learned purely from data.
3. Better accuracy than baselines with limited training data.

Negatives:
----------
1. The motion model is too simplistic. The authors in their response to earlier questions say that a generic feed-forward neural network could be used to model more complicated motions. However, then the novelty of their framework is not clear -- as then the proposed model would just be a couple of neural networks to learn the motion and observation models.

2. The observation model again is too simplistic (e.g., one dimensional observations), and is proposed to be a generic feed-forward network. Here again, the technical novelty is not clear.

3. The histogram based representation is not scalable as also highlighted by the authors. Hence, the proposed approach as it is, cannot be applied to more complicated settings.

4. In Figure 5(a,b), where they compare the state-estimation accuracy with other baselines (i.e., LSTMs), it is clear that the accuracy of the LSTM has not saturated, while that of their model has. They should do larger scale experiments with more training data (e.g., 10k,100k,500k samples). 
Note that while sample efficiency is a desirable property (also discussed in Section 6.2), we do expect models with prior knowledge to work better for small number of samples than models which do not assume any structure. Experiments with larger number of samples would be insightful.",,4.0,3.0
937,True,The Neural Noisy Channel,"This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair,  based on the authors' previous work on segment to segment neural transduction (SSNT) model. For the noisy channel model, the key difference from sequence-to-sequence is that the complete sequence y is not observed beforehand. SSNT handles this problem elegantly by performing incremental alignment and prediction. However, this paper does not present anything that is particular novel on top of the SSNT. The SSNT model is still applicable by reverting the input and output sequences. The authors said that an unidirectional LSTM has to be used as an encoder instead of the bidirectional LSTM, but I think the difference is minor. The decoding algorithm presented in the appendix is relatively new. 

The experimental study is very comprehensive and strong, however, there is one important baseline number that is missing for all the experiments. Can you give the number that uses direct + LM + bias, and if you can give direct + bias number would be even better. Although using a LM for the direct model does not make a lot of sense mathematically, however, it works pretty well in practice, and the LM can rescore and smooth your predictions, see 

Deep Speech 2: End-to-End Speech Recognition in English and Mandarin

from Baidu for example. I think the LM may be also the key to explain why noisy channel is much better than direct model in Table 3. A couple minor questions are

1. it is not very clear to me is your direct model in the experiments SSNT or sequence-to-sequence model?

2. O(|x|^2*|y|) training complexity is OK, but it would be great to further cut down the computational cost, as it is still very expensive for long input sequences, for example, for paragraph or document level modeling, or speech sequences.

938,True,The Neural Noisy Channel,"This is an interesting paper that investigates alternative neural machine translation approaches. Falling back to traditional concepts machine translation while using powerful neural models is essential to understanding the leap achieved by neural machine translation over conventional methods.

In terms of related work, there is a close relation to the paper Alignment-Based Neural Machine Translation (Alkhouli et al. 2016)*, whether in the decomposition of the model into neural alignment and  lexical/word probabilities, or using a weighted log-linear combination to combine the models which are eventually used in a standalone decoder. A notable difference is that the paper uses direct translation models (as opposed to the inverted ones proposed by the authors here), and the fact that the models are trained on word-aligned data which speeds up training. As for the alignment model, the former choses to model non-monotone source jumps whereas the current paper choses two classes (emit and shift) to model monotone alignments. In (Alkhouli et al. 2016), decoding is done using a beam search decoder that hypothesizes alignments and word translations

As for the MT experiments, did you try the model combination using larger data (i.e. >=100M tokens). How long did the current models take to train on the 184K sentence pairs you are using? It would also be interesting to see how much you gain/lose if the models were to be trained using given word alignments (e.g. obtained using GIZA++). Training then should be faster.

* ",,,
939,True,The Neural Noisy Channel,"This paper proposes to use an SSNT model of p(x|y) to allow for a noisy channel model of conditional generation that (still) allows for incremental generation of y. The authors also propose an approximate search strategy for decoding, and do an extensive empirical evaluation.

PROs: This paper is generally well written, and the SSNT model is quite interesting and its application here well motivated. Furthermore, the empirical evaluation is very well done, and the authors obtain good results.

CONs: One might be concerned about whether the additional training and decoding complexity is warranted. For instance, one might plausibly obtain the benefits of the proposed approach by reranking (full) outputs from a standard seq2seq model with a score combining p(y|x), p(x|y), and p(y). (It's worth noting that Li et al. (NAACL 2016) do something similar for conversation modeling). At the same time, being able to rerank during search may be helpful, and so it might be nice to see some experiments addressing this.

Other Comments: 
 - Given that the main thrust of the paper is to provide a model for p(x|y), the paper might be slightly clearer if Section 2 were presented from the perspective of modeling p(x|y) instead of switching back to p(y|x) as in the original Yu et al. paper. 

 - It initially seems strange to suggest a noisy-channel model as a way of addressing the ""explaining away"" problem, since now you have an explicit, uncalibrated p(y) term. However, since seq2seq models appear to naturally do a lot of target-side language modeling, incorporating an explicit p(x|y) term seems quite clever.

Strong points:
- well written, interesting idea of combining various sources of information in a Bayesian framework for seq2seq models
Handling something in an online manner typically makes things more difficult, and this is what the authors are trying to do here - which is definitely of interest to the community
- strong experimental section, with some strong results (though not complete: see weak points)

Weak points:
- Authors do not improve on computational complexity (w.r.t Tillmann proposal), hence the algorithms may be found difficult to apply in scenarios where inputs may be long (this already takes into account a rather constrained model of alignment latent variables)
- What about the baseline where you only combine direct, LM and bias contributions (no channel)? Was there any (non-obvious) algorithmic constraint why - this has not been included?

Some other (minor) comments:

- Related to the first weak point: can you elaborate more on how the clue of your work is conceptually different from the work of Tillmann et al. (1997) (except, of course, the fact you use connectionist discriminative models to derive particular conditional probabilities). 
- How sensitive is the model to different choices of hyper-parameters in eq (3). Do you naively search through the search space of those, or do something more clever?
- Some more comments on details of the auxiliary direct model would be definitely of interest.
- How crucial is the correct choice of the pruning variables (K1 and K2)? 
- Sec. 2: makes no Markovian assumptions -> no first-order Markovian assumption?

This work is applied to the task of predictive different driving behaviors from human drivers, and combines behaviors at test time, often switching behaviors within seconds. Prediction loss is lower than the similar but non-competitive architecture used as a baseline.
It is not very clear how to interpret the results, what is the real impact of the model. If behaviors switch very often, can this really be seen as choosing the best driving mode for a given situation? Maybe the motivation needs to be rephrased a little to be more convincing?

This paper introduces a neural network architecture and training procedure for predicting the speed of a vehicle several seconds into the future based on video and vehicle state input. The architecture allows several RNNs to compete to make the best predictions, with only the best prediction receiving back propagation training at each time step. Preliminary experimental results show that this scheme can yield reduced prediction error.

 It is not clear how the best-performing RNN is chosen for each time point at test time. That is, how is the “integrated prediction” obtained in Fig. 7? Is the prediction the one with minimum error over all of the output layers? If so, this means the prediction cannot be made until you already know the value to be predicted.

It seems possible that a larger generic RNN might be able to generate accurate predictions. If I understand correctly, the competitive architectures have many more parameters than the baseline. Is the improved performance here due to the competitive scheme, or just a larger model? 

A large amount of additional work is required to sustain the claim that this scheme is successfully extracting driver ‘intentions’. It would be interesting to see if the scheme, suitably extended, can automatically infer the intention to stop at a stop sign vs slowing but not stopping due to a car in front, say, or to pass a car vs simply changing lanes. Adding labels to the dataset may enable this comparison more clearly.

More generally, the intention of the driver seems more related to the goals they are pursuing at the moment; there is a fair amount of work in inverse reinforcement learning that examines this problem (some of it in the context of driving style as well).

944,False,PREDICTION OF POTENTIAL HUMAN INTENTION USING SUPERVISED COMPETITIVE LEARNING,"This paper proposes a neural network architecture for car state prediction while driving based on competitive learning. Competitive learning creates several duplicates of the baseline neural architecture and during training only updates the architecture with minimum loss. The experiments compare the competitive learning approach to a single baseline architecture on a driving benchmark task. The paper is understandable but could benefit from some copy editing. 

The competitive learning approach seems rather adhoc and this paper feels quite incomplete without significant discussion and comparisons to ensembling. Much recent work has shown that duplicating and ensembling neural architectures can produce gains, and it’s not clear why competitive learning is better than ensembling, it seems less theoretically sound to me.

There is a huge confound in the experiments due to the competitive learning architecture having many more free parameters than the baseline architecture. Again I think comparing to ensembling with the same number of architectures duplicated and perhaps comparing to a single baseline with larger hidden layers to make the total number of free parameters comparable is critical to validating the proposed approach.

The graphical model of the driving process depicted in figure 1 seems nonsensical. If e is observed then all variables are known given the dependencies shown. Further, it is at best very poor notation to say that the driving action d decided at time t affects the vehicle state s at that same time. It should be that s_t depends on d_(t-1). Also, according to this figure the driving decision d does not depend on the observed vehicle state x which also seems invalid.

946,True,Energy-based Generative Adversarial Networks,"This paper introduces an energy-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and provides theoretical and empirical results modeling a number of image datasets (including large-scale versions of categories of ImageNet). As far as I know energy-based GANs (EBGAN) were introduced in Kim and Bengio (2016), but the proposed version makes a number of different design choices. 

First, it does away with the entropy regularization term that Kim and Bengio (2016) introduced to ensure that the GAN discriminator converged to an energy function proportional to the log density of the data (at optimum). This implies that the discriminator in the proposed scheme will become uniform at convergence as discussed in the theoretical section of the paper, however the introductory text seems to imply otherwise -- that one could recover a meaningful score function from the trained energy-function (discriminator). This should be clarified. 

Second, this version of the EBGAN setting includes two innovations: (1) the introduction of the hinge loss in the value function, and (2) the use of an auto-encoder parametrization for the energy function. These innovations are not empirically justified in any way - this is disappointing, as it would be really good to see empirical results supporting the arguments made in support of their introduction. 

The two significant contributions of this paper are the theoretical analysis of the energy-baesd GAN formalism (showing that the optimum corresponds to a Nash equilibrium) and the impressive empirical results on large images that set a new standard in what straight GAN-style models can achieve.

The theoretical results seem solid to me and make a nice contribution.

Regarding the quantitative results in Table 2, it seems not appropriate to bold the EBGAN line when it seems to be statistically indistinguishable form the Rasmus et al (2015) results. Though it is not mentioned here, the use of bold typically indicates the state-of-the-art. 

I think this paper could be be much stronger if the two novel contributions to the energy-based GAN setting were more thoroughly explored with ablation experiments. That being said, I think this paper has already become a contribution other are building on (including at least two other ICLR submissions) and so I think it should be accepted for publication at ICLR.

947,True,Energy-based Generative Adversarial Networks,"This paper proposes a novel extension of generative adversarial networks that replaces the traditional binary classifier discriminator with one that assigns a scalar energy to each point in the generator's output domain. The discriminator minimizes a hinge loss while the generator attempts to generate samples with low energy under the discriminator. The authors show that a Nash equilibrium under these conditions yields a generator that matches the data distribution (assuming infinite capacity). Experiments are conducted with the discriminator taking the form of an autoencoder, optionally including a regularizer that penalizes generated samples having a high cosine similarity to other samples in the minibatch.

Pros:
* The paper is well-written.
* The topic will be of interest to many because it sets the stage for the exploration of a wider variety of discriminators than currently used for training GANs.
* The theorems regarding optimality of the Nash equilibrium appear to be correct.
* Thorough exploration of hyperparameters in the MNIST experiments.
* Semi-supervised results show that contrastive samples from the generator improve classification performance.

Cons:
* The relationship to other works that broaden the scope of the discriminator (e.g. [1]) or use a generative network to provide contrastive samples to an energy-based model ([2]) is not made clear in the paper.
* From visual inspection alone it is difficult to conclude whether EB-GANs produce better samples than DC-GANs on the LSUN and CelebA datasets.
* It is difficult to assess the effect of the PT regularizer beyond visual inspection as the Inception score results are computed with the vanilla EB-GAN.

Specific Comments
* Sec 2.3: It is unclear to me why a reconstruction loss will necessarily produce very different gradient directions.
* Sec 2.4: It is confusing that ""pulling-away"" is abbreviated as ""PT"".
* Sec 4.1: It seems strange that the Inception model (trained on natural images) is being used to compute KL scores for MNIST. Using an MNIST-trained CNN to compute Inception-style scores seems to be more appropriate here.
* Figure 3: There is little variation across the histograms, so this figure is not very enlightening.
* Appendix A: In the proof of theorem 2, it is unclear to me why a Nash equilibrium of the system exists.

Typos / Minor Comments
* Abstract: ""probabilistic GANs"" should probably be ""traditional"" or ""classical"" GANs.
* Theorem 2: ""A Nash equilibrium ... exists""
* Sec 3: Should be ""Several papers were presented""

The general idea of suprising-driven feedback is interesting for online prediction task. It is a simple enough idea that seems to bring some significant improvements. However, the paper in its current form has some important flaws.

- Overall, the paper writing could be improved. In particular, section 2.4 and 2.5 is composed mostly by the equations of the forward and backward propagation of feedback RNN and feedback LSTM. However, author provides no analysis along with those equations. It is therefore not clear what insight the author tries to express in those sections. In addition, feedback RNN is not evaluated in the experimental section, so it is not clear why feedback RNN is described.

- The experimental evaluation is limited. Only one dataset enwik8 is explored. I think it is necessary to try the idea on different datasets to see if feedback LSTM sees some consistent improvements.
Also, author claims state-of-art on enwik8, but hypernetwork, already cited in the paper, achieves better results (1.34 BPC, table 4 in the hypernetworks paper).

- Author only compares to methods that do not use last prediction error as extra signal. I would argue that a comparison with dynamic evaluation would be more fair. 
 Feedback LSTM uses prediction error as extra input in the forward prop, while dynamic evaluation  backprop it through the network and change the weight accordingly. Also they don't propagate the prediction error in the same way, they both leverage ""extra"" supervised information through the prediction errors.

952,True,Hyperband: Bandit-Based Configuration Evaluation for Hyperparameter Optimization,"This paper discusses Hyperband, an extension of successive halving by Jamieson & Talwalkar (AISTATS 2016). Successive halving is a very nice algorithm that starts evaluating many configurations and repeatedly cuts off the current worst half to explore many configuration for a limited budget.

Having read the paper for the question period and just rereading it again, I am now not entirely sure what its contribution is meant to be: the only improvement of Hyperband vs. successive halving is in the theoretical worst case bounds (not more than 5x worse than random search), but you can (a) trivially obtain that bound by using a fifth of your time for running random configurations to completion and (b) the theoretical analysis to show this is said to be beyond the scope of the paper. That makes me wonder whether the theoretical results are the contribution of this paper, or whether they are the subject of a different paper and the current paper is mostly an empirical study of the method?
I hope to get a response by the authors and see this made clearer in an updated version of the paper.

In terms of experiments, the paper fails to show a case where Hyperband actually performs better than the authors' previous algorithm successive halving with its most agressive setting of bracket b=4. Literally, in every figure, bracket b=4 is at least as good (and sometimes substantially better) than Hyperband. That makes me think that in practice I would prefer successive halving with b=4 over Hyperband. (And if I really want Hyperband's guarantee of not being more than 5x worse than random search I can run random search on a fifth of my machines.) 
The experiments also compare to some Bayesian optimization methods, but not to the most relevant very closely related Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization methods that have been dominating effective methods for deep learning in that area in the last 3 years: ""Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization"" by Swersky, Snoek, and Adams (2013) already showed 5x speedups for deep learning by starting with smaller datasets, and there have been several follow-up papers showing even larger speedups. 

Given that this prominent work on multitask Bayesian optimization exists, I also think the introduction, which sells Hyperband as a very new approach to hyperparameter optimization is misleading. I would've much preferred a more down-to-earth pitch that says ""configuration evaluation"" has been becoming a very important feature in hyperparameter optimization, including Bayesian optimization, that sometimes yields very large speedups (this can be quantified by examples from existing papers) and this paper adds some much-needed theoretical understanding to this and demonstrates how important configuration evaluation is even in the simplest case of being used with random search. I think this could be done easily and locally by adding a paragraph to the intro.

As another point regarding novelty, I think the authors should make clear that approaches for adaptively deciding how many resources to use for which evaluation have been studied for (at least) 23 years in the ML community -- see Maron & Moore, NIPS 1993: ""Hoeffding Races: Accelerating Model Selection Search for Classification and Function Approximation"" (",,7.0,5.0

Maybe not far worse, but no characteristics of the task are presented, so one might already get results within the error bars of CVST by picking a random configuration at no cost at all ... Why not run Hyperband as long as CVST and then compare apples with apples?

954,True,Hyperband: Bandit-Based Configuration Evaluation for Hyperparameter Optimization,"This paper presents Hyperband, a method for hyperparameter optimization where the model is trained by gradient descent or some other iterative scheme. The paper builds on the successive halving + random search approach of Jamieson and Talwalkar and addresses the tradeoff between training fewer models for a longer amount of time, or many models for a shorter amount of time. Effectively, the idea is to perform multiple rounds of successive halving, starting from the most exploratory setting, and then in each round exponentially decreasing the number of experiments, but granting them exponentially more resources. In contrast to other recent papers on this topic, the approach here does not rely on any specific model of the underlying learning curves and therefore makes fewer assumptions about the nature of the model. The results seem to show that this approach can be highly effective, often providing several factors of speedup over sequential approaches.

Overall I think this paper is a good contribution to the hyperparameter optimization literature. It’s relatively simple to implement, and seems to be quite effective for many problems. It seems like a natural extension of the random search methodology to the case of early stopping. To me, it seems like Hyperband would be most useful on problems where a) random search itself is expected to perform well and b) the computational budget is sufficiently constrained so that squeezing out the absolute best performance is not feasible and near-optimal performance is sufficient. I would personally like to see the plots in Figure 3 run out far enough that the other methods have had time to converge in order to see what this gap between optimal and near-optimal really is (if there is one).

I can see why it’s a useful comparison because it demonstrates the benefit of parallelism over sequential methods, but virtually all of these other methods also have parallel extensions. I think if random2x is shown, then I would also like to see SMAC2x, Spearmint2x, TPE2x, etc. I also think it would be worth seeing 3x, 10x, and so forth and how Hyperband fares against these baselines.

The continued analysis of this aspect, including analyzing how the gradient flow improves the given tasks, is of great interest and helps show it as an inherent property of zoneout.

956,True,Zoneout: Regularizing RNNs by Randomly Preserving Hidden Activations,"Paper Summary
This paper proposes a variant of dropout, applicable to RNNs, in which the state
of a unit is randomly retained, as opposed to being set to zero. This provides
noise which gives the regularization effect, but also prevents loss of
information over time, in fact making it easier to send gradients back because
they can flow right through the identity connections without attenuation.
Experiments show that this model works quite well. It is still worse that
variational dropout on Penn Tree bank language modeling task, but given the
simplicity of the idea it is likely to become widely useful.

Strengths
- Simple idea that works well.
- Detailed experiments help understand the effects of the zoneout probabilities
  and validate its applicability to different tasks/domains.

Weaknesses
- Does not beat variational dropout (but maybe better hyper-parameter tuning
  will help).

Quality
The experimental design and writeup is high quality.

Clarity
The paper clear and well written, experimental details seem adequate.

Originality
The proposed idea is novel.

Significance
This paper will be of interest to anyone working with RNNs (which is a large
group of people!).

Minor suggestion-
- As the authors mention - Zoneout has two things working for it - the noise and
  the ability to pass gradients back without decay. It might help to tease apart
the contribution from these two factors. For example, if we use a fixed
mask over the unrolled network (different at each time step) instead of resampling
it again for every training case, it would tell us how much help comes from the
identity connections alone.",,8.0,4.0
957,False,Linear Time Complexity Deep Fourier Scattering Network and Extension to Nonlinear Invariants,"Overview: This work seems very promising, but I believe it should be compared with more baselines, and more precisely described and explained, from a signal processing point of view.

Pros:
New descriptor
Fast implementation

Cons:
a) Lack of rigor
b) Too long accordingly to the content
c) The computational gain of the algorithm is not clear
d) The work is not compared with its most obvious baseline: a scattering transform

I will detail each cons.

a) Section 1:
The author  motivates the use of scattering transform because it defines a contraction of the space that relies on geometric features.
"" The nonlinearity used in the scattering network is the complex modulus which is piecewise linear.""
A real modulus is piecewise linear. A complex modulus has a shape of bell when interpreting C as R^2. Could you clarify?
\Omega is not introduced.

Could you give a precise reference (page+paper) of this claim: “Higher order nonlinearity refers to |x|^2 instead of |x| as it is usually done in the scattering network.” ?

Section 2:
The motivation of the non-linearity is not clear. First, this non-linearity might potentially increase a lot the variance of your architecture since it depends on higher moments(up to 4). I think a fair analysis would be to compute numerically the normalized variance (e.g. divided by the averaged l^2 norm), as a sanity check. Besides, one should prove that the energy is decreasing. It is not possible to argue that this architecture is similar to a scattering transform which has precise mathematical foundations and those results are required, since the setting is different.

Permutation is not a relevant variability.

The notion of sparsity during the whole paper sometimes refers to the number of 0 value, either the l^1 norm. Mathematically, a small value, even 10^-1000 is still a non 0 value.

Did you compute the graph of the figure 4 on the bird dataset? You might use a ratio instead for clarity. 

The wavelet that is defined is not a morlet wavelet (",,4.0,5.0
958,False,Linear Time Complexity Deep Fourier Scattering Network and Extension to Nonlinear Invariants,"I find the general direction of the work is promising but, in my opinion, the paper has three main drawback. While the motivation and overall idea seem very reasonable, the derivation is not convincing mathematically. The experiments are limited and the presentation needs significant improvement.  The writing and wording are in general poorly structured to the point that it is sometimes difficult to follow the proposed ideas. The overall organization needs improvement and the connection between sections is not properly established. The paper could be significantly improved by simply re-writing it.

I'm not fully convinced by the motivation for the proposed non-linearity (|c|^2), as described on page 5. The authors argue that  (Waldspurger, 2016) suggests that higher order nonlinearities might be  beneficial for sparsity. But unless I'm missing something, that work seems  to suggest that in the general case higher order nonlinearities can be neglected. Could you please comment on this?

On the other hand, adding a second order term to the descriptor seems
an interesting direction, as long as stability to small variations is preserved (which should be shown experimentally)

The experimental section is rather limited. The paper would be stronger with a thorough numerical evaluation. The presented results, in my opinion, do not show convincingly a clear advantage of the proposed method over a standard implementation of the scattering transform. In order to show the merits of the proposed approach, it would be really helpful to directly compare running times and compression rates.

Questions: 
- Can you show empirically that the proposed higher order nonlinearity
produces sparser representations than the complex modulus?

Other minor issues:
- The proof of Section 2.1, should be preceded by a clear statement in the form of a proposition
- ""Hadamart"" -> Hadamard
- ""Valid set"" -> Validation set
- ""nonzeros coefficients"" -> nonzero coefficients
- Figure 3 is difficult to understand. Please provide more details.
- Figure 5 is supposed to show a comparison to a standard implementation of the Scattering network, but it doesn't seem to be such comparison in that figure. Please explain.
- Please verify the references. The first reference states ""MALLAT"".

959,False,Linear Time Complexity Deep Fourier Scattering Network and Extension to Nonlinear Invariants,"This work proposes 3 improvements to scattering networks: (1) a non-linearity that allows Fourier-domain computation, (2) compact-supported (in the Fourier domain) representations, and (3) computing additional variance features.

The technical contributions seem worthwhile, since #1 and #2 may result in better speed, while #3 may improve accuracy. Unfortunately, they are poorly described and evaluated. If the writing was clear and the evaluation more broad, I would have recommended acceptance since the ideas have merit.

One of the biggest faults of the presentation is that many sentences are overly long and full of unnecessary obfuscating language, e.g. the last paragraph of Section 1 (though unfortunately this permeates the whole paper).

Likewise, most equations are made unnecessarily complicated. For example, Eq. 5 does not need 4 lines and so many indexes, but just 2:
X_0 = x
X_l = |X_{l-1} * Psi_l|
with the |.| operator being element-wise. Most of the hyperparameter dependencies and indexes are not necessary, as well as the repetition of iterations. The same reasoning can be applied to most Equations 5 to 13.

The argument of cardinality (Eq. 14) does not really help prove that variance is more informative. In fact, we could just as easily write that the cardinality of S concatenated with any (!) other quantity is >= the cardinality of S. Another argument from machine learning theory would be better.

The authors should strive to make the arguments in the paper less hyperbolic and better substantiated. The claims about finding invariants of any input (Abstract) and fundamental structures (last paragraph of Section 1.2.1) are not really backed up by any math. How can we have any guarantees about singling out, for example, semantically relevant representations? The learning procedures in machine learning give at least some guarantees, while here the feature building seems a bit more heuristic. This does not take away from the main idea, but this part needs to be better researched.

960,False,Adding Gradient Noise Improves Learning for Very Deep Networks,"The authors propose to add noise to the gradients computed while optimizing deep neural networks with stochastic gradient based methods. They show results multiple data sets which indicate that the method can counteract bad parameter initialization and that it can be especially beneficial for training more complicated architectures.

The method is tested on a multitude of different tasks and architectures. The results would be more convincing if they would be accompanied by confidence intervals but I understand that some of the experiments must have taken very long to run. I like that the results include both situations in which the gradient noise helps a lot and situations in which it doesn’t seem to add much to the other optimization or initialization tools employed. The quantity of the experiments and the variety of the models provide quite convincing evidence that the effect of the gradient noise generalizes to many settings. The results were not always that convincing. In Section 4.2, the method only helped significantly when a sub-optimal training scheme was used, for example. The results on MNIST are not very good compared to the state-of-the-art. Since the method is so simple, I was hoping to see more theoretical arguments for its usefulness. That said, the experimental investigations into the importance of the annealing procedure, the comparison with the effect of gradient stochasticity and the comparison with weight noise, provide some additional insight.

The paper is well written and cites relevant prior work. The proposed method is described clearly and concisely, which is to be expected given its simplicity. 

The proposed idea is not very original. As the authors acknowledge, very similar algorithms have been used for training and it is pretty much identical to simulating Langevin dynamics but with the goal of finding a single optimum in mind rather than approximating an expected value. The work is the evaluation of an old tool in a new era where models have become bigger and more complex.

Despite the lack of novelty of the method, I do think that the results are valuable. The method is so easy to implement and seems to be so useful for complicated model which are hard to initialize, that it is important for others in the field to know about it. I suspect many people will at least try the method. The variety of the architectures and tasks for which the method was useful suggests that many people may also add it to their repertoire of optimization tricks. 


Pros:
* The idea is easy to implement.
* The method is evaluated on a variety of tasks and for very different models.
* Some interesting experiments which compare the method with similar approaches and investigate the importance of the annealing scheme.
* The paper is well-written.


Cons:
* The idea is not very original.
* There is no clear theoretical motivation of analysis.
* Not all the results are convincing.",,7.0,5.0
961,False,Adding Gradient Noise Improves Learning for Very Deep Networks,"The authors consider a simple optimization technique consisting of adding gradient noise with a specific schedule. They test their method on a number of recently proposed neural networks for simulating computer logic (end-to-end memory network, neural programmer, neural random access machines).

On these networks, the question of optimization has so far not been studied as extensively as for more standard networks. A study specific to this class of models is therefore welcome. Results consistently show better optimization properties from adding noise in the training procedure.

One issue with the paper is that it is not clear whether the proposed optimization strategy permits to learn actually good models, or simply better than those that do not use noise. A comparison to results obtained in the literature would be desirable.

For example, in the MNIST experiments of Section 4.1, the optimization procedure reaches in the most favorable scenario an average accuracy level of approximately 92%, which is still far from having actually learned an interesting problem representation (a linear model would probably reach similar accuracy). I understand that the architecture is specially designed to be difficult to optimize (20 layers of 50 HUs), but it would have been more interesting to consider a scenario where depth is actually beneficial for solving the problem.",,4.0,4.0
962,False,Adding Gradient Noise Improves Learning for Very Deep Networks,"This paper presents a simple method of adding gradient noise to improve the training of deep neural networks. This paper first appeared on arXiv over a year ago and while there have been many innovations in the area of improving the training of deep neural networks in tha time (batch normalization for RNNs, layer normalization, normalization propagation, etc.) this paper does not mention or compare to these methods. 

In particular, the authors state ""However, recent work on applying batch normalization to recurrent networks (Laurent et al., 2015) has not shown promise in improving generalization ability for recur- rent architectures, which are the focus of this work."" This statement is simply incorrect and was thoroughly explored in, e.g. Cooijmans et al. (2016) that establish that batch normalization is effective for RNNs.

The proposed method itself is extremely simple and is similar to numerous training strategies that have previously been advocated in the literature. As a result the contribution would be incremental at best and could be significant with sufficiently strong empirical results supporting this particular variant. However, as discussed above there are now multiple training strategies and algorithms in the literature that are not empirically compared.

964,False,Discovering objects and their relations from entangled scene representations,"This paper proposes a relation network (RN) to model relations between input entities such as objects.  The relation network is built in two stages.  First a lower-level structure analyzes a pair of input entities.  All pairs of input entities are fed to this structure.  Next, the output of this lower-level structure is aggregated across all input pairs via a simple sum.  This is used as the input to a higher-level structure.  In the basic version, these two structures are each multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).

Overall, this is an interesting approach to understanding relations among entities.  The core idea is clear and well-motivated -- pooling techniques that induce invariance can be used to learn relations.  The idea builds on pooling structures (e.g. spatial/temporal average/max pooling) to focus on pairwise relations.  The current pairwise approach could potentially be extended to higher-order interactions, modulo scaling issues.

Experiments on scene descriptions and images verify the efficacy of relation networks.  The MLP baselines used are incapable of modeling the structured dependencies present in these tasks.  It would be interesting to know if pooling operators (e.g. across-object max pooling in an MLP) or data augmentation via permutation would be effective for training MLPs at these tasks.  Regardless, the model proposed here is novel and effective at handling relations and shows promise for higher-level reasoning tasks.",,7.0,4.0
965,False,Discovering objects and their relations from entangled scene representations,"+ Understanding relations between objects is an important task in domains like vision, language and robotics. However, models trained on real-life datasets can often exploit simple object properties (not relation-based) to identify relations (eg: animals of bigger size are typically predators and small-size animals are preys). Such models can predict relations without necessarily understanding them. Given the difficulty of the task, a controlled setting is required to investigate if neural networks can be designed to actually understand pairwise object relations. The current paper takes a significant step in answering this question through a controlled dataset. Also, multiple experiments are presented to validate the ""relation learning"" ability of proposed Relation Networks (RN).

+ The dataset proposed in the paper ensures that relation classification models can succeed only by learning the relations between objects and not by exploiting ""predator-prey"" like object properties.

+ The paper presents very thorough experiments to validate the claim that ""RNs"" truly learn the relation between objects.
  1. In particular, the ability of the RN to force a simple linear layer to disentangle scene description from VAE latent space and permuted description is very interesting. This clearly demonstrates that the RN learns object relations.
  2. The one-shot experiments again demonstrate this ability in a convincing manner. This requires the model to understand relations in each run, represent them through an abstract label and assign the label to future samples from the relationship graph.

Some suggestions:

- Is g_{\psi}(.) permutation invariant as well. Since it works on pairs of objects, how did you ensure that the MLP is invariant to the order of the objects in the pair?
- The RNs need to operate over pairs of objects in order to identify pairwise interactions. However, in practical applications there are more complicated group interactions. (eg. ternary interaction: ""person"" riding a ""bike"" wears ""helmet""). Would this require g(.) of RN to not just operate on pairs but on every possible subset of objects in the scene? More generally, is such a pairwise edge-based approach scalable to larger number of objects?
- The authors mention that "" a deep network with a sufficiently large number of parameters and a large enough training set should be capable of matching the performance of a RN"". This is an interesting point, and could be true in practice. Have the authors investigated this effect by trying to identify the minimum model capacity and/or training examples required by a MLP to match the performance of RN for the provided setup? This would help in quantifying the significance of RN for practical applications with limited examples. In other words, the task in Sec. 5.1 could benefit from another plot: the performance of MLP and RN at different amounts of training samples.
- While the simulation setup in the current paper is a great first-step towards analyzing the ""relation-learning"" ability of RNs, it is still not clear if this would transfer to real-life datasets. I strongly encourage the authors to experiment on real-life datasets like Coco, visual genome or HICO as stated in the pre-review stage.
- Minor: Some terminologies in the paper such as ""objects"" and ""scene descriptions"" used to refer to abstract entities can be misleading for readers from the object detection domain in computer vision. This could be clarified early on in the introduction.
- Minor: Some results like Fig. 8 which shows the ability of RN to generalize to unseen categories are quite interesting and could be moved to the main draft for completeness.

The paper proposes a network which is capable of understanding relationships between objects in a scene. This ability of the RN is thoroughly investigated through a series of experiments on a controlled dataset.

966,False,Discovering objects and their relations from entangled scene representations,"This paper proposes relation networks in order to model the pairwise interactions between objects in a visual scene. 
The model is very straight forward, first an MLP (with shared weights) is applied to each pair of objects. Finally a prediction is created by an MLP which operates by summing non-linear functions of these pairs of objects. 
Experimental evaluation is done in a synthetic dataset that is generated to fit the architecture hand-crafted in this paper. 

The title of the paper claims much more than the paper delivers. Discovering objects and their relations is a very important task.
However, this paper does not discover objects or their relations, instead, each objects is represented with hand coded ground truth attributes, and only a small set of trivial relationships are ""discovered"", e.g., relative position. 

Discovering objects and their relationships has been tackled for several decades in computer vision (CV). The paper does not cite or compare to any technique in this body of literature. This is typically refer to as ""contextual models"".

Can the proposed architecture help object detection and/or scene classification? would it work in the presence of noise (e.g, missing detections, non accurate detection estimates, complex texture)? would it work when the attributes of objects are estimated from real images? 
 
I'll be more convinced if experiments where done in real scenes. In the case of indoor scenes, datasets such as NYUv2, Sun-RGB-D, SceneNN, Chen et al CVPR 14 (text-to-image-correference) could be used. In outdoor scenes, KITTI and the relationships between cars, pedestrians and cyclist could also serve as benchmark. 

Without showing real scenes, this paper tackles a too toy problem with a very simple model which does not go much further than current context models, which model pairwise relationships between objects (with MRFs, with deep nets, etc).

The whole package becomes a bit entangled and complex and it is hard to figure out what causes the claimed good performance.

The paper is well written, and the exposition is both thorough and precise. There are several appendices which justify various design decisions in detail. I wish more papers in our field would take this degree of care with the exposition!

The log-likelihood results are quite strong, especially given that most of the competitive algorithms are based on continuous latent variables. Probably the main thing missing from the experiments is some way to separate out the contributions of the architecture and the inference algorithm. (E.g., what if a comparable architecture is trained with VIMCO, or if the algorithm is applied to a previously published discrete architecture?)

I’m a bit concerned about the variance of the gradients in the general formulation of the algorithm. See my comment “variance of the derivatives of F^{-1}” below. I think the response is convincing, but the problem (as well as “engineering principles” for the smoothing distribution) are probably worth pointing out in the paper itself, since the problem seems likely to occur unless the user is aware of it. (E.g., my proposal of widely separated normals would be a natural distribution to consider until one actually works through the gradients — something not commonly done in the age of autodiff frameworks.)

Another concern is how many sequential operations are needed for inference in the RBM model. (Note: is this actually an RBM, or a general Boltzmann machine?) The q distribution takes the form of an autoregressive model where the variables are processed one at a time. Section 3 mentions the possibility of grouping together variables in the q distribution, and this is elaborated in detail in Appendix A. But the solution requires decomposing the joint into a product of conditionals and applying the CDFs sequentially. So either way, it seems like we’re stuck handling all the variables sequentially, which might get expensive.

As far as I can tell, the gradients of the variational objective w.r.t. the parameters phi of the variational posterior q(z, zeta) are incorrect, due to some of the probabilistic dependences being ignored. Most significantly, the gradient w.r.t parameters of q(z|x) seems to contain only the term obtained by differentiating -KL(q||p), but no contribution from the term E_q[log P(x|zeta)] in the objective. This likelihood term is considerably harder to deal with than the KL term as it does not factorize, so it is important to explain how it is taken into account when updating parameters of q(z|x). Ignoring this term amounts to training q(z|x) to match the prior p(z), teaching it to ignore the current observation x (assuming a factorial q(zeta|z) and r(zeta|z) that does not depend on x). This makes q(z|x) a completely ineffective recognition model.

Note that making r dependent on x or using a hierarchical posterior does allow q(z|x) to learn some dependence on x as z_i will depend on zeta_{j",,,
972,False,An Information Retrieval Approach for Finding Dependent Subspaces of Multiple Views,"The authors develop a way learn subspaces of multiple views such that data point neighborhoods are similar in all of the views.  This similarity is measured between distributions of neighbors in pairs of views. The motivation is that this is a natural criterion for information retrieval.

I like the idea of preserving neighborhood relationships across views for retrieval tasks. And it is nice that the learned spaces can have different dimensionalities for different views.  However, the empirical validation seems preliminary.

The paper has been revised from the authors' ICLR 2016 submission, and the revisions are welcome, but I think the paper still needs more work in order to be publishable.  In its current form it could be a good match for the workshop track.

The experiments are all on very small data sets (e.g. 2000 examples in each of train/test on the MNIST task) and not on real tasks.  The authors point out that they are not focusing on efficiency, and presumably computation requirements keep them from considering larger data sets.  However, it is not clear that there is any conclusion that can be drawn that would apply to more realistic data sets.  Considering the wealth of work that's been done on multi-view subspace learning, with application to real tasks, it is very hard to see this as a contribution without showing that it is applicable in such realistic settings.

On a more minor point, the authors claim that no other information retrieval based approaches exist, and I think this is a bit overstated.  For example, the contrastive loss of Hermann & Blunsom ""Multilingual models for compositional distributed semantics"" ACL 2014 is related to information retrieval and would be a natural one to compare against.

The presentation is a bit sloppy, with a number of vague points and confusing wordings.  Examples:
- the term ""dependency"" gets used in the paper a lot in a rather colloquial way.  This gets confusing at times since it is used in a technical context but not using its technical definition.
- ""an information retrieval task of the analyst"": vague and not quite grammatical
- ""the probability that an analyst who inspected item i will next pick j for inspection"" is not well-defined
- In the discussion of KL divergence, I do not quite follow the reasoning about its relationship to the ""cost of misses"" etc.  It would help to make this more precise (or perhaps drop it?  KL divergence is pretty well motivated here anyway).
- Does C_{Penalty} (7) get added to C (6), or is it used instead?  I was a bit confused here.
- It is stated that CCA ""iteratively finds component pairs"".  Note that while CCA can be defined as an iterative operation, it need not (and typically is not) solved that way, but rather all projections are found at once.

Authors argue that scalability is not their first concern, which is understandable, but if they are going to make some remarks about the computational cost, it better be clarified that the reported cost is for some small part of their overall approach rather than “time complexity”.

- Since authors position their approach as an alternative to CCA, they should remark about how CCA, even though a nonconvex optimization problem, can be solved exactly with computational cost that is linear in the data size and only quadratic with dimensionality even with a naive implementation. The method proposed in the paper does not seem to be tractable, at least not immediately. 

- The empirical results with synthetic data are a it confusing. First of all the data generation procedure is quite convoluted, I am not sure why we need to process each coordinate separately in different groups, and then permute and combine etc. A simple benchmark where we take different linear transformations of a shared representation and add independent noise would suffice to confirm that the proposed method does something reasonable. I am also baffled why CCA does not recover the true subspace - arguably it is the level of additive noise that would impact the recoverability - however the proposed method is nearly exact so the noise level is perhaps not so severe. It is also not clear if authors are using regularization with CCA - without regularization CCA can be have in a funny manner. This needs to be clarified.

974,False,An Information Retrieval Approach for Finding Dependent Subspaces of Multiple Views,"This paper presents an multi-view learning algorithm which projects the inputs of different views (linearly) such that the neighborhood relationship (transition probabilities) agree across views.

This paper has good motivation--to study multi-view learning from a more information retrieval perspective. Some concerns:
-- The time complexity of the algorithm in its current form is high (see last paragraph of page 4). This might be the reason why the authors have conducted experiments on small datasets, and using linear projections.
-- The proposed method does have some nice properties, e.g., it does not require the projections to have the same dimension across views (I like this). While it more directly models neighborhood relationship than CCA based approaches, it is still not directly optimizing typical retrieval (e.g., ranking-based) criteria. On the other hand, the contrastive loss in

is certainly a relevant ""information retrieval"" approach, and shall be discussed and compared with.

My major concern about this paper is the experiments. As I mentioned in my previous comments, there are limited cases where linear mapping is more desirable than nonlinear mappings for dimension reduction. While the authors have argued that linear projection may provide better interpretability, I have not found empirical justification in this paper. Moreover, one could achieve interpretability by visualizing the projections and see what variations of the input is reflected along certain dimensions; this is commonly done for nonlinear dimension reduction methods. 

I agree that the general approach here generalizes to nonlinear projections easily, but the fact that the authors have not conducted experiments with nonlinear projections and comparisons with nonlinear variants of CCA and other multi-view learning algorithms limits the significance of the current paper.

975,False,Semi-Supervised Detection of Extreme Weather Events in Large Climate Datasets,"This work presents a novel 3D CNN architecture for climate event detection that combines an unsupervised auto-encoder reconstruction loss with YOLO like bounding box prediction. The approach is trained and evaluated on a large-scale, simulated climate dataset labeled by a costly heuristic approach called TECA. 

For the most part, the paper is nicely written (minor comments below) and addresses an important and well motivated problem. The authors provide sufficient model details to allow reproduction (although public code would be preferred). I find the experiments a bit unconvincing (see below) but appreciate the attention to model capacity (via number of parameter) when comparing the 2D and 3D model variants.

I am concerned that the evaluation may be insufficient to assess the effectiveness of this method. An IoU threshold of 0.1 allows for many rather poor detections to count as true positives. If the goal of this work is to count the number of such instances this is defensible, but for localization this seems overly loose.Furthermore, the 3D CNN architecture (which is one of the the core novelties of this work compared to past efforts) does not seem capable of producing variable sized boxes (as noted in the last paragraph of page 7), which I imagine results in poorer performance at higher IoU thresholds (as many of the weather events appear small). 
The experiments also feel inconclusive about the effect of temporal modeling and semi-supervision. The temporal component does not seem to matter in the supervised settings (2D 51.45 mAP - 3D 51.00 mAP) but improves somewhat in the semi-supervised case (2D 51.11 mAP - 3D 52.92 mAP). Whereas the additional unlabeled data seems to hurt in the 2D case but improve results for the 3D model. Could the authors provide confidence intervals for these numbers? I would like to see further discussion of these trends especially with respect to the effect of the loss weights (alpha, beta, and gamma). 

I also note that it is not clear if both the 2D and 3D models were trained for equivalent time periods (seems like no from last paragraph of page 7). Could a plot of training and validation accuracy for each model be presented for comparison? 

Finally, is there any baseline approach the authors could report or compare too? Without one, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of the approach with respect to the difficulty of the problem.

Preliminary Rating:
I think this is an interesting paper that is well motivated but feel the experiments as presented do not seem adequate to support any conclusive trends. I would like to see the mAP trends across a wider range of IoU values and further discussion of training procedure, loss weight settings, and reasons for lack of bounding box variability in the 3D model (as stated above). 

Clarification:
In the paper you say ""While climate models are run on a 3D grid, with the vertical dimension corresponding to 30 levels; we only consider surface quantities (i.e. 2D data) in this study."" Could you elaborate on what the surface quantities correspond to? Is it the highest cloud level?

The github links for data and code will be really helpful for reproducing results (I haven't looked carefully, but this is great). The revision addressed many issues, including the additional results. As such I am upgrading my rating from a 5 to a 6 and recommend acceptance of the paper.]

The paper proposes to apply deep nets to perform detection and localization of extreme weather events in simulated weather data. The problem is related to object detection in computer vision in that the input is a 2D “image” (multichannel spatial weather data) or 3D “video” (temporal version of the data) and the output is a bounding box (spatial-temporal localization of a weather event) and class label (weather event type). It differs from standard object detection in that the input has multiple heterogenous channels and labeled data is scarce.

A simple but quite reasonable deep net is proposed for the task based on similar approaches in computer vision. While proposal based systems are most popular in vision currently (in particular Faster-RCNN) the proposed approach is simple and a fine starting point. There is little innovation on the part of the detection system, but as noted, it is a valid application of ideas from computer vision to the task at hand. 

The authors propose both a supervised approach (only ground truth bounding box location/label is used) and a semi-supervised approach that additionally incorporates the reconstruction loss as a regularization. In all cases the losses are fairly standard and again, reasonable. The only confusing bit is that the “semi-supervised” loss actually has all the labels used for the “supervised” loss and additionally incorporates the reconstruction loss. Hence, the “semi-supervised” loss is actually stronger, which makes the terminology a bit confusing.

The paper is easy to follow, but notation is sloppy. For example, above equation 5 it states that “the loss is a weighted combination of reconstruction error and bounding box regression loss”; actually it’s a combination of the supervised and unsupervised loss (Lsup and Lunsup), and Lrec is not defined (although I assume Lrec=Lunsup). The paper is fairly non-technical, but nevertheless these minor issues should be fixed. (E.g., see also reference to “figure 4 and 4”). 

The biggest concern w the paper though is experimental results. Only a single figure and table of results are shown (figure 4 and table 4). The metrics are not defined (what is mean average recall?). Only 2D versus 3D version of the model are shown, and supervised and semi-supervised. Moreover, numbers seem a bit all over the place, without consistent patterns (e.g., why is 2D supervised better than the seemingly much strong 3D semi-supervised?). One of the things that is unclear is how many events are actually in the training/testing data, and more importantly, how good are these results in absolute terms? Regardless, the experiments are fairly sparse and ablation studies and more discussion lacking. It is also unclear if future researchers will be able to reproduce the experimental setting (a commitment to open-source the data or a way to reproduce the experiments would be critical for future authors).

Minor nit: the authors use both a classification loss and an “objectness” loss. I’ve never seen both used together like this (normally objectness is used in two-stage object proposal systems where in the first stage class-agnostic proposals are given and in the second stage these are cropped and a class-specific classifier is applied). I strongly suspect removing the objectness loss would not impact results since the classification loss should provide strictly stronger supervisory signal. Regardless, this is a fairly non-standard choice and should be justified (experimentally).

Overall this is a borderline paper. I do believe that it is valuable to apply computer vision techniques to a domain that I’ve see little work on in our community. That being said, I have no expertise on this type of data -- it’s possible this deep learning techniques are now routinely used in the climate science literature (I suspect not, though). Overall, there is little novelty on the algorithmic side in this paper (the equations in section 3 are commonly used in the cv literature). The use of reconstruction loss to improve results in the data-sparse setting is interesting, but the experimental results are inconclusive. The experimental validation is generally insufficient. Reproducibility for future research is difficult unless the data is open-sourced. Overall, I think this paper is a good start, and with improved experiments and more careful writing I think could eventually make for a decent paper.",,6.0,3.0
977,True,Deep Variational Bayes Filters: Unsupervised Learning of State Space Models from Raw Data,"This paper presents a variational inference based method for learning nonlinear dynamical systems. Unlike the deep Kalman filter, the proposed method learns a state space model, which forces the latent state to maintain all of the information relevant to predictions, rather than leaving it implicit in the observations. Experiments show the proposed method is better able to learn meaningful representations of sequence data.

The proposed DVBF is well motivated, and for the most part the presentation is clear. The experiments show interesting results on illustrative toy examples. I think the contribution is interesting and potentially useful, so I’d recommend acceptance.

The SVAE method of Johnson et al. (2016) deserves more discussion than the two sentences devoted to it, since the method seems pretty closely related. Like the DVBF, the SVAE imposes a Markovianity assumption, and it is able to handle similar kinds of problems. From what I understand, the most important algorithmic difference is that the SVAE q network predicts potentials, whereas the DVBF q network predicts innovations. What are the tradeoffs between the two?  Section 2.2 says they do the latter in the interest of solving control-related tasks, but I’m not clear why this follows. 

Is there a reason SVAEs don’t meet all the desiderata mentioned at the end of the Introduction?

Since the SVAE code is publicly available, one could probably compare against it in the experiments. 

I’m a bit confused about the role of uncertainty about v. In principle, one could estimate the transition parameters by maximum likelihood (i.e. fitting a point estimate of v), but this isn’t what’s done. Instead, v is integrated out as part of the marginal likelihood, which I interpret as giving the flexibility to model different dynamics for different sequences. But if this is the case, then shouldn’t the q distribution for v depend on the data, rather than being data-independent as in Eqn. (9)?",,7.0,3.0
978,True,Deep Variational Bayes Filters: Unsupervised Learning of State Space Models from Raw Data,"This is mainly a (well-written) toy application paper. It explains SGVB can be applied to state-space models. The main idea is to cast a state-space model as a deterministic temporal transformation, with innovation variables acting as latent variables. The prior over the innovation variables is not a function of time. Approximate inference is performed over these innovation variables, rather the states. This is a solution to a fairly specific problem (e.g. it doesn't discuss how priors over the beta's can depend on the past), but an interesting application nonetheless. The ideas could have been explained more compactly and more clearly; the paper dives into specifics fairly quickly, which seems a missed opportunity.

979,True,Deep Variational Bayes Filters: Unsupervised Learning of State Space Models from Raw Data,"The paper proposes to use the very standard SVGB in a sequential setting like several previous works did. However, they proposes to have a clear state space constraints similar to Linear Gaussian Models: Markovian latent space and conditional independence of observed variables given the latent variables. However the model is in this case non-linear. These assumptions are well motivated by the goal of having meaningful latent variables.
The experiments are interesting but I'm still not completely convinced by the regression results in Figure 3, namely that one could obtain the angle and velocity from the state but using a function more powerful than a linear function. Also, why isn't the model from (Watter et al., 2015) not included ?
After rereading I'm not sure I understand why the coordinates should be combined in a 3x3 checkerboard as said in Figure 5a.

980,False,Boosted Generative Models,"This paper extends boosting to the task of learning generative models of data. The strong learner is obtained as a geometric average of “weak learners”, which can themselves be normalized (e.g. VAE) or un-normalized (e.g. RBMs) generative models (genBGM), or a classifier trained to discriminate between the strong learner at iteration T-1 and the true data distribution (discBGM). This latter method is closely related to Noise Contrastive Estimation, GANs, etc.

The approach benefits from strong theoretical guarantees, with strict conditions under which each boosting iteration is guaranteed to improve the log-likelihood. The downside of the method appears to be the lack of normalization constant for the resulting strong learner and the use of heuristics to weight each weak learner (which seems to matter in practice, from Sec. 3.2). The discriminative approach further suffers from an expensive training procedure: each round of boosting first requires generating a “training set” worth of samples from the previous strong learner, where samples are obtained via MCMC.

The experimental section is clearly the weak point of the paper. The method is evaluated on a synthetic dataset, and a single real-world dataset, MNIST: both for generation and as a feature extraction mechanism for classification. Of these, the synthetic experiments were the clearest in showcasing the method. On MNIST, the baseline models are much too weak for the results to be convincing. A modestly sized VAE can obtain 90 nats within hours on a single GPU, clearly an achievable goal. Furthermore, despite arguments to the contrary, I firmly believe that mixing base learners is an academic exercise, if only because of the burden of implementing K different models & training algorithms. This section fails to answer a more fundamental question: is it better to train a large VAE by maximizing the elbow, or e.g. train 10 iterations of boosting, using VAEs 1/10th the size of the baseline model ? Experimental details are also lacking, especially with respect to the sampling procedure used to draw samples from the BGM. The paper would also benefit from likelihood estimates obtained via AIS.

With regards to novelty and prior work, there is also a missing reference to “Self Supervised Boosting” by Welling et al [R1]. After a cursory read through, there seems to be strong similarities to the GenBGM approach which ought to be discussed.

Overall, I am on the fence. The idea of boosting generative models is intriguing, seems well motivated and has potential for impact. For this reason, and given the theoretical contributions, I am willing to overlook some of the issues highlighted above, and hope the authors can address some of them in time for the rebuttal.

981,False,Boosted Generative Models,"The authors propose two approaches to combine multiple weak generative models into a stronger one using principles from boosting. The approach is simple and elegant and basically creates an unnormalized product of experts model, where the individual experts are trained greedily to optimize the overall joint model. Unfortunately, this approach results in a joint model that has some undesirable properties: a unknown normalisation constant for the joint model and therefore an intractable log-likelihood on the test set; and it makes drawing exact samples from the joint model intractable. These problems can unfortunately not be fixed by using different base learners, but are a direct result of the product of experts formulation of boosting.
  
The experiments on 2 dimensional toy data illustrate that the proposed procedure works in principle and that the boosting formulation produces better results than individual weak learners and better results than e.g. bagging. But the experiments on MNIST are less convincing: Without an undisputable measure like e.g. log-likelihood it is hard to draw conclusions from the samples in Figure 2; and visually they look weak compared to even simple models like e.g. NADE.

I think the paper could be improved significantly by adding a quantitative analysis: investigating the effect of combining undirected (e.g. RBM), undirected (e.g. VAE) and autoregressive (e.g. NADE) models and by measuring the improvement over the number of base learners. But this would require a method to estimate the partition function Z or estimating some proxy.

982,True,Recurrent Batch Normalization,"Contributions
The paper presents an adaptation of batch normalization for RNNs in the case of LSTMs, along the horizontal depth. Contrary to previous work from (Laurent 2015; Amodei 2016), the work demonstrates that batch-normalizing the hidden states of RNNs can improve optimization, and argues with quantitative experiments that the key factor to making this work is proper initialization of parameters, in particular gamma. Experiments show some gain in performance over vanilla LSTMs on Sequential MNIST, PTB, Text8 and CNN Question-Answering.

Novelty+Significance
Batch normalization has been key for training deeper and deeper networks (e.g. ResNets) and it seems natural that we would want to extend it to RNNs.  The paper shows that it is possible to do so with proper initialization of parameters, contrary to previous work from (Laurent 2015; Amodei 2016). Novelty comes from where to batch norm (i.e. not in the cell update) and in the per-time step statistics. 

Adding batch normalization to LSTMs incurs additional computational cost and bookkeeping; for training speed comparisons (e.g. Figure 2) the paper only compares LSTM and BN-LSTM by iteration count; given the additional complexity of the BN-LSTM I would have also liked to see a wall-clock comparison.

As RNNs are used across many tasks, this work is of interest to many.  However, the results gains are generally minor and require several tricks to work in practice. Also, this work doesn’t address a question about batch normalization that it seems natural that it helps with faster training, but why would it also improve generalization? 

Clarity
The paper is overall very clear and well-motivated. The model is well described and easy to understand, and the plots illustrate the points clearly.

Comprehensive set of experiments though it is questionable if the empirical gains are significant enough to justify the increased model complexity as well as computational overhead.

ii) The hyper parameters are nearly constant over the experiments. It is ruled out that they have not been picked in favor of one of the methods. E.g. just judging from the text, a different learning rate could have lead to equally fast convergence for vanilla LSTM.

The experiment on pMNIST also solidly shows the advantage of batch norm in the recurrent setting for establishing long term dependencies.

Also shown is the regret loss is satisfied at different scales of the network, by layer, neuron and whole network. 

The Taylor approximation can be used to investigate activation configurations of the network, and used to connect this to difficulty in optimizing  at kinks in the loss surface, along with an empirical study of exploration of activation surface of the SGD/Adam/RMSprop optimizers, the more exploration the better the resulting training loss.

Not that it impacts the paper but the weaker performance of the SGD could be related to the fixed learning rate, if we anneal this learning rate, which should improve performance, does this translate to more exploration and tightening between the actual loss and the Taylor loss?

986,False,Neural Taylor Approximations: Convergence and Exploration in Rectifier Networks,"This paper develops a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of the training error. The result is quite general that covers the training of a wide range of neural network models. The key idea of the paper is approximate the training loss by its linear approximation. Since its linearity in the variables (thus convex), the authors plug in results that has been developed in the literature of online learning. 

This paper has good novelty in using the Taylor approximation thus greatly simplifying the analysis of the behaviour of the model. However, there are two problems about the main result of this paper, Theorem 2.

1. It is not clear if the Taylor optimum would converge or not. 
As noticed by the authors, the upper bound is path dependent. Appendix 3 tries to claim that this Taylor optimum indeed converges, but the proof is buggy. In the proof of Lemma 2, it is proved that the difference between two sequential Taylor optimum is approaching 0. Note that this is actually weaker than being Cauchy sequence and insufficient to guarantee convergence.

2. The lefthand side of Equation (3) (I will denote it by L3 in this review) is not equivalent to training error. 
An upper bound on this average error is not sufficient to guarantee the convergence of the training error neither. Take the gradient descent for example (thus each minibatch x_0^n is the whole training set), the convergence of the training error should be lim_{n -> \infty} l(f_{w^n}(x_0^n), y^n). The convergence of L3 is necessary but not sufficient to imply the convergence of the training error.

Another concern about Theorem 2 (but it is minor compared to the two problems mentioned above) is that to achieve the O(1/\sqrt{n}) rate, the algorithm has to pick a particular learning rate. Larger or smaller learning rate (in the order of n) will lead to significantly worse regret. But in the experiments of the paper, the learning rates are not picked according to the theorem.

Overall, this paper has a good motivation and good novelty. It could be further developed into a good paper. But due to the two problems and a buggy proof mentioned above, I think it is not ready for publish yet.

Thus, they propose to simulate the effects of EM by a noisy adaptation layer, effectively a softmax, that is added to the architecture during training, and is omitted at inference time.

Pros: the paper examines a training scenario which is a real concern for big dataset which are not carefully annotated.

992,False,Towards Understanding the Invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks,"The paper proposes to provide a theoretical explanation for why deep convolutional neural networks are invertible (at-least, when going back from certain intermediate layers to the image itself). It does so by considering the invertibility of a single layer, assuming the convolutional filters essentially correspond to incoherent measurements satisfying RIP.

In my opinion, while this is an interesting direction of research, the paper is not ready for publication. I feel the treatment does not go sufficiently towards explaining the phenomenon in deep neural networks. Even after reading the response from the authors, I feel the results are only a minor variation of the standard results from compressive sensing for sparse reconstruction with incoherent measurements.

A deep neural network is fundamentally different from a single layer---it is the ""deep"" part that makes the forward task work. As the authors note, there is significant deterioration when IHT is applied recursively----therefore, at best the theory explains the partial invertibility of a single layer. That a single layer is approximately invertible isn't surprising, that a cascade of layers *is*.

For any theoretical analysis of this phenomenon to be useful, I believe it must go beyond analyzing a single compressive measurement-type layer, and try to explain how much of the same theory holds for a cascade. I say this because it's entirely possible that the sparse recovery theory breaks down beyond a single layer, and invertibility ends up being a property caused by correlations between the weights of different layers. In other words, there is no way to tell from the current results for individual layers whether they are in fact a step towards explaining the invertibility of whole networks.

The authors propose a theoretical framework to analyze the recoverability of sparse activations in intermediate layers of deep networks, using theoretical tools from compressed sensing. They relate the computations that are performed by a CNN and a particular recovery algorithm (Iterative Hard Thresholding, IHT). They present proofs of necessary conditions for recoverability to hold, and also show detailed empirical evidence of how they hold in practice.

This is a well-written paper that presents a new angle on why the current CNN architectures work so well. The authors give a brief but sufficient review of the fundamentals of compressed sensing, present their main result relating feed-forward networks and IHT (a surprising result), and progress naturally to a detailed experimental section. The introductory analysis at the beginning of Section 3, in particular, delivers the gist of why the method should work with very approachable and simple math, which is not common in theoretical papers. The increasing complexity of the experiments, done in small steps, shows a nice progression from artificial distributions to a realistic experiment.

A few aspects should be improved. First of all, although the treatment of ReLU non-linearities is sufficient, it is assumed with little discussion that max-pooling non-linearities shouldn't present a problem as well. A discussion of how this is inverted (e.g., with pooling switches) is needed.

The relationship between feed-forward nets and Algorithm 1 assumes tied weights. It might be worthwhile to mention that the result is stronger for the case of RNNs, where this is the case by design.

Although it might be obvious, it might help some readers to briefly note that the reconstruction algorithm is meant to be applied to each layer sequentially, basing the activations of each layer on the one above it (in back-propagation order).

Finally, the filter coherence measure must be defined either mathematically or with a proper reference.

The experiments in 4.5 are misleading and together with 4.4 they are contradictory to their theoretical results. 
Foremost, the readers need to be aware that the decoders with switch units are very powerful (if you ever trained one you would know it too). Therefore what figure 4 presents is extremely misleading because it *only* takes the very last conv layer and use their proposed linear reconstruction algorithm to recover that layer’s input only.  The rest was propagated with the very powerful decoder plus switch units information (see [6] for how powerful the decoder is).  Visually, we can also see how much info switch units carry: for their conv 5 reconstruction with random activation, there is no meaningful info carried by the activation values but all through switch units and we can still obtain the silhouette of the objects in the original images; in fact, pool-1’s switch units alone carries at least 64x224x224 bit information. Their results back in the appendix (Figure5) also shows their reconstruction algorithm’s weakness. The lower layer has extremely bad reconstruction quality from the proposed algorithms. The higher the layer, the better the reconstruction from their proposed algorithms because decoder together switch units has more chance to correct the reconstruction.What the authors should do, is to use their IHT to reconstruct all the way, following what has been done in [1]’s linear reconstruction algorithm, which the authors here failed to compare against, despite its high relevance. In fact, the author of [1] used to be in charge of this submitted project and proposed this experimental approach, with a slightly different algorithm that is presented in [1]; but current authors of this submission failed in achieving similar reconstruction results with their algorithm and hence can only perform their reconstruction algorithm over a single layer. The biggest difference between the reconstruction algorithm from [1] and this submission is that the former used pseudo-inverse of the weight matrix and the latter used the transpose because in their theory, the weight matrix is approximate orthogonal hence its transpose is approximately its inverse.
 There is another serious issue with using high-up conv layer to verify their theoretical claim: recall that the excuse this submission used to discard ReLU non-linearity is that [1] introduced the pairing phenomenon, however, [1] stressed that it only appeared in the first few layers. Hence the authors should have at least chosen the first few layers for their experiments; yet, they knowingly only presented their analysis of the highest layer. 
Table 3 again presents very misleading results. First their “random activation” has a relative error 1.414 for activation space. But if we simply pick zero vectors instead of “random”, it gives 1 as a relative error, which is much smaller than 1.414. Therefore, this “relative error” in the activation space is a very inappropriate measurement for the reconstruction quality from their algorithm. But measuring the relative error in the input space is also a bad metric because of the powerful effects from the decoders. In fact, the term “relative error” is a paraphrase of the evaluation method used in [1], where it is called “reconstruction ratio”. However, it is a much more appropriate measurement coupling the reconstruction algorithm used in [1] because the reconstruction from [1] will always be a subset of the original input by using the pseudo-inverse.
 Recall that in 4.4, the authors approximate the conv weight matrix for conv(5,2) has approximately 0.05-0.1 distortion constant, which means that the “relative error” based on their Theorem 3.3 is 0.6-0.2, but in reality, the relative error is 1.051, which is not only worse than their theoretical guarantee but even worse than simply choosing zero vector as reconstruction. Keep in mind that these results are built on top of the assumption that ReLU does not exist, if we add it on top, these results in Table3 and Figure5 can get further downgraded. One question why there is such a huge gap. In fact, such bad reconstruction results based on their algorithm is not surprising because after all, unlike random weights, the learned conv weights are not approximately orthogonal so Model-RIP does not fit into realistic CNN models. In fact, the coherence is a very direct measurement of how “orthogonal” the learned weights are, which both this submission and [5] (again this submission took over [5]’s idea) measure this quantity: the higher the coherence the less orthogonal.  
",,,
995,False,Towards Understanding the Invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks,"Section 4, experiments: This section contains so much misleading information to misguide the audience.
 The issues with 4.1 has been discussed in Section2(1).
The experiments in 4.4 are very deceiving.The minor misleading part is the title of Figure 3(b), ( c)  saying “before/after ReLU”, note the ReLU they refer to is at the input level not the *activation* level. In other words, they did not consider ReLU after the linear responses,  and only compare whether the input to this conv layer goes through ReLU or not, which does not add any difficulty to their theoretical analysis, because they assumed the input comes from the span of the conv weights, which is also [1] and [5]’s assumption. However, the most serious issue is how they collect the results for Figure 3. I tried to replicate their result for conv(1,2) because the authors claim that “we choose conv(5, 2), while other layers show similar results”. Precisely, I pass randomly sampled ImageNet Validation images through VGG-16, take the activation of conv(1,2) after max-pooling to obtain c, and then reconstruct conv(1,1) activation by multiplying c with the transpose of the conv weights W^T after subtracting the bias to obtain the reconstruction (W^T*c), and calculate the term, ||W^T c||/||c||.  However, the norm ratio I obtained is 3.16 +- 0.10, very far from their 1 +- 0.1.  My experiments give a distortion constant \delta strictly bigger than 2, which is out of the range of 0 and 1 hence a meaningless value. This gap between our result and their result can potentially originate from the following causes: the authors using fancier sparse approximation method for c instead of following the procedures of feedforward CNNs, the authors discarding ReLU on the linear response therefore their c has negative components, and the authors have bugs in their code.  
",,,
996,False,Towards Understanding the Invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks,"Section 3 Continue:
There are again several issues with their proof to the reconstruction bounds. Lemma B.3 and B.4 carry out a very crude estimation on \|c-h\|, since the author discard any potential contribution of filters activated from max-pooling but belong to the set of original filters that form the input signal x. That is, \|c_{\Omega^c}\| can potentially be covered by \|h_{\Pi - \Omega}\|. Intuitively, if max-pooling chooses to keep a shifted filter positive and the rest zero and if the shifts of filters are highly correlated, then even if the activated filter is not one of the original filters that constitute x, this activated filter still potentially cover x along the direction of the correct filter and therefore too much information can be lost without taking into such contribution into consideration. Moreover, the logic (i.e. proof technique) behind the reconstruction bounds (Theorem 3.3) is the same as that in Theorem A.5 from [1]. The idea is to decompose the l_2 norm of the reconstruction (or reconstruction signal) into “original/ground truth” +  “difference”  and then bound the reconstruction ratio [1] (this term is renamed as “relative error” in this work) with the aid of the singular values of the weight matrix W. But again, the authors failed to address the similarity but rather attempt to present the proof as different as possible to create artificial novelty.  Finally, their final bound is very suboptimal and only consider 2 max-pooling regions. 
 The entire section 3 is conducted under the assumption of linear responses. Because the compressed sensing model, Model-RIP, is fundamentally a linear model. The formulation (see equation1) only bounds the norm but not the metric. In other words, (1-\delta)|x|<|Wx|<(1+\delta)|x| is what the authors attempt to prove (but with flaws), i.e. a norm preserving property between the input and its linear responses—this has been discussed in [5] but the authors did not cite or relate to this work—despite [5] informs the authors to explain the similarity during their previous submission attempt. However, preserving linear norms do not give any reconstruction guarantee because of ReLU can theoretically ruin the upper bound, by, for example, zeroing all activations if they are all negative.
the authors cannot draw any conclusion from their theoretical results to any implication in training or network design, all they concluded is the last paragraph on page 14, which is rather meaningless.  
",,,
997,False,Towards Understanding the Invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks,"Section 3, Analysis: This section contains many contents that are either a copy from [1]&[5] or invalid.
Proposition 1 is a trivial special case of Proposition A.1 from [1], because the pseudo-inverse of an orthogonal matrix is simply its transpose, which is the set up in Prop 1. Also since Prop 1 assumes that \Phi spans the entire input space, then range(W) easily becomes R^(M*D), however this assumption is generally invalid, which was empirically verified by Table S.1 from [1]’s appendix for the case of deep CNNs for CIFAR-10/100. The authors clearly copied [1]’s idea and decide to present Prop 1 since they know [1] very well, but they did not address this copying action. They should have cited [1]’s Prop A.1, then present Porp 1 as a corollary and explain their set-up is a simplified version with no novel technicality. 
 Following Proposition 1, the author cited [1] (the only time they mentioned it throughout this submission) and claims that based on [1]’s result they can assume linear responses (“assuming that all of the entries in the vectors are real numbers, rather than only non-negative.”) However, [1] never claims that linear responses are acceptable (the authors of [1] in fact even did experiments with no non-linearity and the results significantly dropped) and [1] finds that only the first few convolution convolutional layers appear such pairing phenomenon. But in this submission, the experimental section focuses on the last convolutional layer of VGGNet, which by no means has such negative and positive pairing property. Therefore, their arguments of leaving out ReLU and assuming linear responses are groundless.
The authors fail to address convolution in their proof of Theorem 3.1 which resulting the proof to the convolution layer is no different from fully connected layer. More specifically, when proving theorem 3.1, the authors need Lemma A.1, however there is a severe issue with the proof of Lemma A.1—it does not properly take convolution into consideration. Note that they assume the “shift” of the same convolution filter has expected dot product 0 (E((w_{I,m1}^j_1)T(w_{I,m1}^{j2})) = 0 if j_1 \neq j_2, this assumption only holds if the convolution filters are of high frequency but it is a common knowledge that real convolution filters are more often smooth than highly oscillatory, and the dot products between shifts by a small number of pixels can be large, opposite from being 0 as the authors claim here. Their assumption contradicts the important fact that convoluted smooth filters stay highly correlated. Also, there is a constant C that is not tracked in Theorem 3.1 —only a “there exists” in a mathematical sense. Not to mention the whole proof is based on random filters which, we stress again, is far away from being realistic. 
",,,
998,False,Towards Understanding the Invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks,"Section 2, Preliminaries:
There are serious issues with the random filter assumption (Section 2.1 and Section 4.1 are addressed together). First of all, we all know very well that random filters have extremely limited ability, especially with very deep networks. No one has in any way successfully applied random filters to deep networks. Second of all, their one-layer results in Table 1 is very off. For instance, [4] used one-layer unsupervised learning to train 1600 conv filters (this submission uses 2048 and 1024 conv filters) that achieved 77.9% accuracy on CIFAR-10, versus their 66% (random)/68% (learned), despite their architecture is far more complicated than [4], which ironically is far beyond the scope of their theoretical setup. But the most inappropriate component is the number of convolutional filters they used. None of the commonly used deep convolutional networks carry these many filters--for their first layer, there are about 30 times more filters than the dimension of its convolutional kernel! Recall that the most valuable part of convolutional layer is that it can use a small number of conv filters to extract abstract features by stacking many of them together. Unsurprisingly, as a consequence of using excessive amount of filters in order to span as much input space as possible, their models carry a huge number of parameters, an architecture design that is totally against the principles of CNNs. Finally, Table 4 shows, random filters can form a weight matrix that is a lot more “orthogonal” than learned filters. And such low coherence, i.e. “orthogonal” property of the weight matrix W, is the backbone of their Model-RIP. Thus some simple, unconvincing shallow networks do not manage to fill in the gap between random filters and learned filters, especially when this gap breaks their primary theoretical promise. 
 Notation in 2.2: The notations introduced in 2.2 are identical to the notations and problem set up used in [1]&[5] except that in [1]&[5], M = 1, which does not change the theoretical fundamentals. In addition, the terminologies such as “shift”, “block” are also shared between [1]&[5] and this submission.
There are serious issues with the Model-RIP setup: the model-RIP mathematical model is in fact nothing fancy. The only difference between model-RIP and a generic compressed sensing RIP model is that model-RIP requires model-sparsity. To be more straightforward, in this case, the model-sparsity corresponds with max-pooling—meaning sparsity is structured so that each pooling region only has at most 1 non-zero element and correspondingly, the assumption on the data space is that it is a linear combination of filters such that at most one filter from each pooling region is used. Note that this is the same assumption as appeared in [1] (see Appendix, equation S1), in fact, this assumption was originally proposed by the first author of [1]. However, the fundamental flaw of this model-RIP setup are first the lack of non-linearity, notice that if ReLU is added after the linear response then the activation can be very close to zero which makes the reconstruction has norm arbitrarily small/close to zero; second real weight matrix W cannot meet the conditions that random matrix can meet, in other words, real W is not even close to being “orthogonal”, even the authors give support along this direction (see Table 4). Hence the actual values of the reconstruction bounds in reality are far from being significant. 
(4)  IHT: This algorithm, again, does not take into any non-linearity on the activation into account.

999,False,Towards Understanding the Invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks,"Section 1, Introduction:
A neural network that can be shown theoretically of high invertibility does not necessarily perform well. For example, ResNets over 34 layers, which are impossible to analyze using the proposed theoretical framework, perform significantly better than VGGNets with much fewer parameters but a lot more depth; by comparison, a standard variational autoencoder would have a lot worse generative power if we set the penalty for the prior KL-divergence term to be very small and encourage good reconstruction.
 “Despite these interesting results, there is no clear theoretical explanations as to why CNNs are invertible yet”. There are multiple issues with this statement. First of all, this invertibility is a rather trivial common knowledge among ML researchers; people don’t like to analytically explore because its theoretical bounds are too bad—as proved once again in this submission. Second of all, their theoretical proof does not consider non-linear layer and it does not have the correct convolutional setup (details to come at Section 3 (3)) and their theoretical bounds have no meaningful implications for training or network design. Third of all, there have been works exploring such signal recovery property with random filters on fully connected layers ([2] and [3]) as well as exploring such property with learned filters on convolutional layers ([1] and [5]). They all have very similar underlying mathematical models and highly resembling reconstruction algorithms ([1] and [2]) with this submission. The authors ignore addressing these important related works. Lastly, their analysis only tackles a single layer, which does not improve upon existing works, especially considering that [2] takes into account of multiple layers as well as dropout stability.

1000,False,Towards Understanding the Invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks,"The invertibility of CNNs has been explored fairly extensively in recent years both empirically [6,7,8,9] and theoretically [1,2,3]. The most critical problem of this submission is “the amount of overlap” to [1,5] in terms of theoretical results as well as approaches for experimental validation. Before providing a list of overlapping contents, we point out the most fundamental differences between these two works:
This submission assumes random filters for their theoretical results whereas [1]&[5] impose assumptions on the learned filters.
[1,5] base their theoretical results (as well as experimental validation) on concatenated ReLU (CReLU) whereas this submission assumes linear responses for theoretical analysis yet their experimental setup uses ReLU networks.


Here is a list of overlaps between these two works:
The notation defined in Section 2.2 is identical as in [1] and [5].
Proposition 1 has identical proof outline as Proposition A.1 in appendix of [1]. In fact, Prop.1 is a special case of Prop.A.1 [1] with more stringent constraints on the weight matrix.
[5] introduced the equivalent theoretical results and called it “norm preserving” (see Theorem 2.2 in [5]) instead of the RIP used in this submission.
The idea behind the proof of reconstruction bounds and the reconstruction algorithm is very similar to that of [1] with a minor difference that they use weight matrix transpose instead of inverse. The “relative error” used for evaluation in this submission is termed as “reconstruction ratio” in [1].
The coherence of the convolution filters (Table 4) is measured to estimate the level of orthogonality of the weight matrix as is done in [5] (see Table 1 and 2 in [5]) and came to the same conclusion that weight matrix is in fact incoherent.

1001,False,Towards Understanding the Invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks,"Summary:
The paper proposes to use Model-RIP, a simple concept from compressed sensing community, to theoretically describe a invertibility of a single convolution + max-pool operation (i.e., without non-linear activation function) assuming that the convolution filters are drawn from random Gaussian distribution. In the high level, they attempted to show that convolution weights consisting of random filters form a roughly orthogonal matrix, hence its transpose times the activation roughly reconstruct the input. Empirically, this submission tries to verify the model-RIP property of learned CNN filters by computing the norm ratio between the activation and the weight transpose multiplying the activation, and verify the reconstruction bounds by computing the relative errors between the input and the reconstructed input through the proposed reconstruction algorithm. Qualitatively, they also try to invert the activation to the previous layer output through the same algorithm then followed up by a learned decoder to reconstruct the raw input.


However, there are many flaws in their assumptions but little useful consequence from enforcing CNNs to their mathematical model. The most evident flaws in their theorems are (1) the weight matrix of learned CNNs does not meet their model-RIP assumption (i.e., low coherence) and (2) even without the first flaw, their reconstruction bound doesn’t hold analytically with ReLU non-linearity: RIP can only bound the norm of the transposed weights times the activation (see Eq. 1) instead of providing enough conditions for a metric-preserving property between input space and activation space [3] since ReLU zeroes out the negative activations, i.e., the activation can be arbitrarily close to zero. Furthermore, the presentations of their experimental results are very misleading and self-contradicting: a pre-trained decoder with switch units is responsible for most of the reconstruction and they only applied their proposed recon algorithm on one layer; the “relative error” does not give reasonable measurement of the reconstruction property, especially in the pixel space; the norm ratio ||W^Tc||/||c|| is also an inappropriate measurement for model-RIP condition, not to mention the discrepancy between the presented norm ratio and the learned filter’s coherence level (if ||W^Tc||/||c|| is close to 1, coherence should be close to 0, but it is actually much larger than 0).

The experiments show that this is superior to semantic hashing. The approach is simple and not very technically interesting. For a code size of 128, the loss compared to a continuous paragraph vector seems moderate.

The paper asks the reader to refer to the Salakhutdinov and Hinton paper for the baseline numbers but I think they should be placed in the paper for easy reference. For simplicity, the paper could show the precision at 12.5%, 25% and 50% recall for the proposed model and semantic hashing. It also seems that the semantic hashing paper shows results on RCV2 and not RCV1. RCV1 is twice the size of RCV2 and is English only so it seems that these results are not comparable. It would be interesting to see how many binary bits are required to match the performance of the continuous representation. A comparison to the continuous PV-DBOW trained with bigrams would also make it a more fair comparison.

Figure 7 in the paper shows a loss from using the real-binary PV-DBOW. It seems that if a user needed high quality ranking after the retrieval stage and they could afford the extra space and computation, then it would be better for them to use a standard PV-DBOW to obtain the continuous representation at that stage.

For a document to encode, the binary vector is obtained by forcing the sigmoid to output a binary output for each of the embedding vector components. The binary vector can then be used for compact storage and fast comparison of documents.
 
Pros:
 
- the binary representation outperforms the Semantic hashing method from Salakhutdinov & Hinton '09
 
- the experimental approach sound: they compare on the same experimental setup as Salakhutdinov & Hinton '09, but since in the meantime document representations improved (Le & Mikolov'14), they also combine this new representation with an RBM to show the benefit of their binary PV-DBOW/PV-DM
 
Cons:
 
- the insertion of the sigmoid to produce binary codes (from Lin & al. '15) in the training process is incremental
 
- the explanation is too abstract and difficult to follow for a non-expert (see details below)
 
- a comparison with efficient indexing methods used in image retrieval is missing.

1004,False,Binary Paragraph Vectors,"This paper presents a method to represent text documents and paragraphs as short binary codes to allow fast similarity search and retrieval by using hashing techniques. The real-valued paragraph vectors by Le & Mikolov is extended by adding a stochastic binary layer on top of the neural network architecture. Two methods for binarizing the final activations are compared: (1) simply adding noise to sigmoid activations to encourage discritization. (2) binarizing the activations in the forward pass and keeping them real-valued in the backward pass (straight-through estimation). The paper presents encouraging results by using straight-through estimation on 20 newsgroup and RCV1 text datasets by using 128 and 32 bit binary codes.

On the plus side, the application presented in the paper is interesting and important. The exposition of the paper is clean and clear. However, the novelty of the approach is limited from a machine learning standpoint. The literature on binary hashing beyond semantic hashing and Krizhevsky's binary autoencoders in 2011 is not explained. An important baseline is missing where real-valued paragraph vectors are learned first, and then converted to binary codes using off-the-shelf hashing methods (e.g. random projection LSH by Charikar, BRE by Kulis & Darrell, ITQ by Gong & Lazebnik, MLH by Norouzi & Fleet, etc.)

Given the lack of novelty and the missing baseline, I do not recommend this paper in its current for publication in the ICLR conference's proceeding. Moving forward, this paper may be more suitable for NLP conferences as it is more on the applied side.

More comments:
- I believe from an practical perspective it may be easier to first learn real-valued paragraph vectors and then quantize them for indexing. That said, an end-to-end approach as proposed in this paper may perform better. I would like to see an empirical comparison between the proposed end-to-end approach and a simpler two stage quantization method suggested here.

1005,True,Learning Curve Prediction with Bayesian Neural Networks,"This paper proposes a new Bayesian neural network architecture for predicting the values of learning curves during the training of machine learning models. This is an exploratory paper, in that the ultimate goal is to use this method in a Bayesian optimization system, but for now the experiments are limited to assessing the quality of the predictions. This builds on previous work in Domhan, 2015, however in this work the model incorporates information from all tested hyperparameter settings rather than just extrapolating from a single learning curve. This paper also explores two MCMC methods for inference: SGLD and SGHMC, but I couldn’t tell if either of these were tested in Domhan, 2015 as well.

The performance seems overall positive, particularly in the initial phase of each curve where there is very little information. In this case, as expected, sharing knowledge across curves helps. One regime which did not seem to be tested, but might be very informative, is when some curves in the training set have been mostly, or fully observed. This might be a case where sharing information really helps.

Something that concerns me about this approach is the timing. The authors stated that to train the network takes about 20-60 seconds. In the worst case, with 100 epochs, this results in a little over 1.5 hours spent training the Bayesian network. This is a non-trivial fraction of the several hours it takes to train the model being tuned.

The Bayesian network makes many separate predictions, as shown in Figure 2. It would be interesting to see how accurate some of these individual pieces are. For example, did you bound the asymptotic value of the learning curve, since you mostly predicted accuracy? If not, did the value tend to lie in [0,1]?

Below are some minor questions/comments.

Figure 1 axes should read “validation accuracy”
Figure 6 can you describe LastSeenValue (although it seems self-explanatory, it’s good to be explicit) in the bottom left figure, and why isn’t it used anywhere else as a baseline?

The key difference from prior work is that (1) the authors learn a neural network that generalizes across hyperparameter settings and (2) the authors use a Bayesian neural network with SGHMC. 
The authors demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective on extrapolating partially observed curves as well as predicting unobserved learning curves on various architectures (FC, CNN, LR and VAE). This seems very promising for Bayesian optimization, I'd love to see an experiment that evaluates the relative advantage of this proposed method :)

Have you thought about ways to handle learning rate decays? Perhaps you could run the algorithm on a random subset of data and extrapolate from that?

I was thinking of other evaluation measures in addition to MSE and LL. In practice, we care about the most promising run. Would it make sense to evaluate how accurately each method identified the best run?

1007,True,Learning Curve Prediction with Bayesian Neural Networks,"This paper is about using Bayesian neural networks to model learning curves (that arise from training ML algorithms). The application is hyper-parameter optimization: if we can model the learning curve, we can terminate bad runs early and save time. The paper builds on existing work that used parametric learning curves. Here, the parameters of these learning curves form the last layer of a Bayesian neural network. This seems like a totally sensible idea. 

I think the main strength of this paper is that it addresses an actual need. Based on my personal experience, there is high demand for a working system to do early termination in hyperparameter optimization. What I'd like to know, which I wish I'd asked during pre-review questions, is whether the authors plan to release their code. Do you? I sincerely hope so, because I think the code would be a significant part of the paper's contribution, since the nature of the paper is more practical than conceptual.

The experiments in the paper seem thorough but the results are a bit underwhelming. I'm less interested in the part about whether the learning curves are actually modeled well, and more interested in the impact on hyperparameter optimization. I was hoping to see BIG speedups as a result of using this method, but I am left feeling unsure how big the speedup really is. Instead of ""objective function vs. iterations"" I would be more interested in the inverse plot: number of iterations needed to get to a fixed objective function value. Since what I'm really interested in is how much time I can save. Ideally there would also be some mention of real time as sometimes these hyperparameter optimization methods are themselves so slow that they end up being unusable. 

Finally, one figure that I feel is missing is a histogram of termination times over different runs. This would provide me with more intuition than all the other figures. Because it would tell me, what fraction of runs are being terminated early. And, how early? Right now I have no sense of this, except that at least *some* runs are clearly being terminated early, since this is neccessary for the proposed method to outperform other methods.

1008,True,Unrolled Generative Adversarial Networks,"This work introduces a novel method for training GANs by displacing simultaneous SGD, and unrolling the inner optimization in the minmax game as a computational graph. The paper is very clearly written, and explains the justification very well. The problem being attacked is very significant and important. The approach is novel, however, similar ideas have been tried to solve problems unrelated to GANs.

The first quantitative experiment is section 3.3.1, where the authors attempt to find the best z which can generate training examples. This is done by using L-BFGS on |G(z) - x|. The claim is that if we're able to find such a z, then the generator can generate this particular training example. It's demonstrated that 0-step GANs are not able to generate many training examples, while unrolled GANs do. However, I find this experiment unreasonable. Being able to find a certain z, which generates a certain sample does not guarantee that this particular mode is high probability. In fact, an identity function can potentially beat all the GAN models in the proposed metric. And due to Cantor's proof of equivalence between all powers of real spaces, this applies to smaller dimension of z as well. More realistically, it should be possible to generate *any* image from a generator by finding a very specific z. That a certain z exists which can generate a sample does not prove that the generator is not missing modes. It just proves that the generator is similar enough to an identity function to be able to generate any possible image. This metric is thus measuring something potentially tangential to diversity or mode-dropping. Another problem with this metric is that that showing that the optimization is not able to find a z for a specific training examples does not prove that such a z does not exist, only that it's harder to find. So, this comparison might just be showing that unrolled GANs have a smoother function than 0-step GANs, and thus easier to optimize for z.

The second quantitative experiment considers mean pairwise distance between generated samples, and between data samples. The first number is likely to be small in the case of a mode-dropping GAN. The authors argue that the two numbers being closer to each other is an indication of the generated samples being as diverse as the data. Once again, this metric is not convincing. 1. The distances are being measured in pixel-space. 2. A GAN model could be generating garbage, and yet still perform very well in this metric.

There are no other quantitative results in the paper. Even though the method is optimizing diversity, for a sanity check, scores for quality such as Inception scores or SSL performance would have been useful. Another metric that the authors can consider is training GAN using this approach on the tri-MNIST dataset (concatenation of 3 MNIST digits), which results in 1000 easily-identifiable modes. Then, demonstrate that the GAN is able to generate all the 1000 modes with equal probability. This is not a perfect metric either, but arguably much better than the metrics in this paper.

- It’s not true that it’s impossible to draw samples from q(z): one can sample x ~ q(x) from the dataset, then draw z ~ q(z|x).

The paper in its current form is not acceptable due to the following reasons:
1. No quantitative evaluation. The authors do include samples from the generative model, which however are insufficient to judge performance of the model. See comment 2.
2. The description of the model is very unclear. I had to indulge in a lot of charity to interpret what the authors ""must be doing"". What does Q(Z) mean? Does it mean the true posterior P(Z | X) ? What is the generative model here? Typically, it's P(Z)P(X|Z). VAEs use a variational approximation Q(Z | X) to the true posterior P(Z | X). Are you trying to say that your model can sample from the true posterior P(Z | X)?

Comments:
1. Using additive noise in the input does not seem like a reasonable idea. Any justification of why this is being done?

1012,False,Improving Sampling from Generative Autoencoders with Markov Chains,"The authors argues that the standard ancestral sampling from stochastic autoencoders (such as the Variational Autoencoder and the Adversarial
Autoencoder) imposes the overly-restrictive constraint that the encoder distribution must marginally match the latent variable prior. They propose, as an alternative, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach that avoids the need to specify a simple parametric form for the prior.

The paper is not clearly written. Most critically, the notation the authors use is either deeply flawed, or there are simple misunderstanding with respect to the manipulations of probability distributions. For example, the authors seem to suggest that both distributions Q(Z|X) and Q(X|Z) are parametrized. For this to be true the model must either be trivially simple, or an energy-based model. There is no indication that they are speaking of an energy-based model. Another example of possible confusion is the statement that the ratio of distributions Q(Z|X)/P(Z) = 1. I believe this is supposed to be a ratio of marginals: Q(Z)/P(X) = 1. Overall, it seems like there is a confusion of what Q and P represent. The standard notation used in VAEs is to use P to represent the decoder distribution and
Q to represent the encoder distribution. This seems not to be how the authors are using these terms. Nor does it seem like there is a single consistent interpretation. 

The empirical results consist entirely of qualitative results (samples and reconstructions) from a single dataset (CelebA). The samples are also not at all up to the quality of the SOTA models.

We do not integrate over the missing
values, but use a procedure that simulates a Markov

Quality:
It seems that the arguments in the paper could be enhanced by more effort and more comprehensive experiments. Performing some of the experiments discussed in the conclusion could certainly help a lot. Some other suggestions:
1- It would be very helpful to add other plots showing the distribution of eigenvalues for some other machine learning method for the purpose of comparison to deep learning.
2- There are some issues about the scaling of the weights and it make sense to normalize the weights each time before calculating the Hessian otherwise the result might be misleading.
3- It might worth trying to find a quantity that measures the singularity of Hessian because it is difficult to visually conclude something from the plots.
4- Adding some plots for the Hessian during the optimization is definitely needed because we mostly care about the Hessian during the optimization not after the convergence.

The main result is that many eigenvalues are approximately zero, such that the Hessian is highly singular, which means that a wide amount of theory does not apply.

The overall point that deep learning algorithms are singular, and that this undercuts many theoretical results, is important but it has already been made: Watanabe. “Almost All Learning Machines are Singular”, FOCI 2007. This is one paper in a growing body of work investigating this phenomenon. In general, the references for this paper could be fleshed out much further—a variety of prior work has examined the Hessian in deep learning, e.g., Dauphin et al. “Identifying and attacking the saddle point problem in high dimensional non-convex optimization” NIPS 2014 or the work of Amari and others.

Experimentally, it is hard to tell how results from the small sized networks considered here might translate to much larger networks. It seems likely that the behavior for much larger networks would be different. A reason for optimism, though, is the fact that a clear bulk/outlier behavior emerges even in these networks. Characterizing this behavior for simple systems is valuable. Overall, the results feel preliminary but likely to be of interest when further fleshed out.

While there are several interesting insights discussed in this paper such as the local flatness of the objective function, as well as the study of the relation between data distribution and Hessian, a somewhat lacking aspect of the paper is that most described effects are presented as general, while tested only in a specific setting, without control experiments, or mathematical analysis.

For example, regarding the concentration of eigenvalues to zero in Figure 6, it is unclear whether the concentration effect is really caused by training (e.g. increasing insensitivity to local perturbations), or the consequence of a specific choice of scale for the initial parameters.

1019,False,Eigenvalues of the Hessian in Deep Learning: Singularity and Beyond,"The work presents some empirical observations to support the statement that “the Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate”.

(i) The Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate at any point in the parameter space, i.e., any network weight matrices.

(ii) The Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate at any critical point.

(iii) The Hessian of the loss functions in deep learning is degenerate at any local minimum, or any global minimum.

None of these interpretations is solidly supported by the observations provided in the paper.

More comments are as follows:

1) The authors state that “we don’t have much information on what the actual Hessian looks like.” Then I just wonder what Hessian is investigated. Is it the actual one or approximate one? Please clarify and provide the references for computing the actual Hessian.

2) It is not clear whether the optimization was done by a batch gradient descent algorithm, i.e., batch back propagation (BP) algorithm, or a stochastic BP algorithm. If the training was done via a stochastic BP algorithm, it is hard to conclude that the the Neural Network has been trained to its local minimum. When it was done by a full-batch BP algorithm, what was the accumulating point? Was it local minimum or global minimum?

3) Since the negative log likelihood function was used as at the end of training, it is essentially a joint learning approach in both the Newton weight matrices and the negative log likelihood vector. Certainly, the whole loss function is not convex in these two parameters. But if least squares error function is used at the end, would it make any difference in claiming the degeneracy of the Hessian?

4) Finally, the statement “There are still negative eigenvalues even when they are small in magnitude” is very puzzling. Potential reasons are:
(a) If the training algorithm did converge, the accumulating points were not local minima, i.e., they were saddle points.
(b) Training algorithms did not converge, or have not converged yet.

1020,True,PixelCNN++: Improving the PixelCNN with Discretized Logistic Mixture Likelihood and Other Modifications,"Summary:
This paper on autoregressive generative models explores various extensions of PixelCNNs. The proposed changes are to replace the softmax function with a logistic mixture model, to use dropout for regularization, to use downsampling to increase receptive field size, and the introduction of particular skip connections. The authors find that this allows the PixelCNN to outperform a PixelRNN on CIFAR-10, the previous state-of-the-art model. The authors further explore the performance of PixelCNNs with smaller receptive field sizes.

Review:
This is a useful contribution towards better tractable image models. In particular, autoregressive models can be quite slow at test time, and the more efficient architectures described here should help with that.

My main criticism regards the severe neglect of related work. Mixture models have been used a lot in autoregressive image modeling, including for multivariate conditional densities and including downsampling to increase receptive field size, albeit in a different manner: Domke (2008), Hosseini et al. (2010), Theis et al. (2012), Uria et al. (2013), Theis et al. (2015). Note that the logistic distribution is a special case of the Gaussian scale mixture (West, 1978).

The main difference seems to be the integration of the density to model integers. While this is clearly a good idea and the right way forward, the authors claim but do not support that not doing this has “proved to be a problem for earlier models based on continuous distributions”. Please elaborate, add a reference, or ideally report the performance achieved by PixelCNN++ without integration (and instead adding uniform noise to make the variables continuous).

60,000 images are not a lot in a high-dimensional space. While I can see the usefulness of regularization for specialized content – and this can serve as a good example to demonstrate the usefulness of dropout – why not use “80 million tiny images” (superset of CIFAR-10) for natural images? Semi-supervised learning should be fairly trivial here (because the model’s likelihood is tractable), so this data could even be used in the class-conditional case.

It would be interesting to know how fast the different models are at test time (i.e., when generating images).",,7.0,5.0
1021,True,PixelCNN++: Improving the PixelCNN with Discretized Logistic Mixture Likelihood and Other Modifications,"It is refreshing that OpenAI has taken the time to resurrect classic heuristics like down-sampling and dropout into PixelCNN. Some sort of AR technique like PixelCNN probably holds the missing keys needed to eventually have decent originally-created images from CIFAR10 or other real-life data-sets. So any engineering streamlining, as in this paper, is welcome to the general public, especially when helping to avoid expensive clusters of GPUs, only DeepMind can afford. In this sense, OpenAI is fulfilling its mission and we are all very grateful! Thus the paper is a welcome addition and we hope it finds its way into what appears to be an experimental CS conference anyway. 

On a more conceptual level, our hope is that OpenAI, with so talented a team, will stop competing in these contrived contests to improve by basis points certain obscure log-likelihoods and instead focus on the bigger picture problems. Why for example, almost two years later, the class-conditional CIFAR10 samples, as on the left of Figure 4 in this paper (column 8 - class of horses), are still inferior to, say, the samples on Figure 4 of reference [2]? Forgive the pun, but aren't we beating a dead horse here? Yes, resolution and sharpness have improved, due to good engineering but nobody in the general public will take these samples seriously! Despite the claims put forward by some on the DeepMind team, PixelCNN is not a ""fully-generative"" neural net (as rigorously defined in section 3 of reference [1]), but merely a perturbative net, in the vain of the Boltzmann machine. After the Procrustean experience of lost decades on Boltzmann machines, the time perhaps has come to think more about the fundamentals and less about the heuristics?

This submission proposes an improved implementation of the PixelCNN generative model. Most of the improvements are small and can be considered as specific technical details such as the use of dropout and skip connections, while others are slightly more substantial such as the use of a different likelihood model and multiscale analysis. The submission demonstrates state-of-the-art likelihood results on CIFAR-10.

My summary of the main contribution:
Autoregressive-type models - of which PixelCNN is an example - are a nice class of models as their likelihood can be evaluated in closed form. A main differentiator for this type of models is how the conditional likelihood of one pixel conditioned on its causal neighbourhood is modelled:

- In one line of work such as (Theis et al, 2012 MCGSM, Theis et al 2015 Spatial LSTM) the conditional distribution is modelled as a continuous density over real numbers. This approach has limitations: We know that in observed data pixel intensities are quantized to a discrete integer representation so a discrete distribution could give better likelihoods. Furthermore these continuous distributions have a tail and assign some probability mass outside the valid range of pixel intensities, which may hurt the likelihood.
- In more recent work by van den Oord and colleagues the conditional likelihood is modelled as an arbitrary discrete distribution over the 256 possible values for pixel intensities. This does not suffer from the limitations of continuous likelihoods, but it also seems wasteful and is not very data efficient.

The authors propose something in the middle by keeping the discretized nature of the conditional likelihood, but restricting the discrete distribution to ones whose CDF that can be modeled as a linear combination of sigmoids. This approach makes sense to me, and is new in a way, but it doesn’t appear to be very revolutionary or significant to me.

The second somewhat significant modification is the use of downsampling and multiscale modelling (as opposed to dilated convolutions). The main motivation for the authors to do this is saving computation time while keeping the multiscale flexibility of the model. The authors also introduce shortcut connections to compensate for the potential loss of information as they perform downsampling. Again, I feel that this modification not particularly revolutionary. Multiscale image analysis with autoregressive generative models has been done for example in (Theis et al, 2012) and several other papers.

Overall I felt that this submission falls short on presenting substantially new ideas, and reads more like documentation for a particular implementation of an existing idea.",,6.0,3.0
1023,True,PixelCNN++: Improving the PixelCNN with Discretized Logistic Mixture Likelihood and Other Modifications,"# Review
This paper proposes five modifications to improve PixelCNN, a generative model with tractable likelihood. The authors empirically showed the impact of each of their proposed modifications using a series of ablation experiments. They also reported a new state-of-the-art result on CIFAR-10.
Improving generative models, especially for images, is an active research area and this paper definitely contributes to it.


# Pros
The authors motivate each modification well they proposed. They also used ablation experiments to show each of them is important.

The authors use a discretized mixture of logistic distributions to model the conditional distribution of a sub-pixel instead of a 256-way softmax. This allows to have a lower output dimension and to be better suited at learning ordinal relationships between sub-pixel values. The authors also mentioned it speeded up training time (less computation) as well as the convergence during the optimization of the model (as shown in Fig.6).

The authors make an interesting remark about how the dependencies between the color channels of a pixel are likely to be relatively simple and do not require a deep network to model. This allows them to have a simplified architecture where you don't have to separate out all feature maps in 3 groups depending on whether or not they can see the R/G/B sub-pixel of the current location.


# Cons
It is not clear to me what the predictive distribution for the green channel (and the blue) looks like. More precisely, how are the means of the mixture components linearly depending on the value of the red sub-pixel? I would have liked to see the equations for them.

It uses an AlexNet (CaffeNet) backbone architecture modified to include batch normalization. Experimental results are presented on the INRIA and ETH datasets.

Pros
- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow

Cons
- The paper's two contributions are too minor to merit publication
- Experimental results should include at least the Caltech pedestrian dataset but likely also the KITTI pedestrian dataset
- Recent work from ECCV 2016 [a], with superior results and much more experimental evaluation, is not cited or discussed

My rating is due primarily to the lack luster contributions. The first claimed contribution is the use of EdgeBoxes as proposals for pedestrian detection. Unless the result of this choice produced a truly surprising experimental result, this is simply too minor to be considered a contribution. Moreover, if this choice is important, then the paper should justify it by showing that other proposal methods (of which there are a great many in addition to Selective Search and Edge Boxes) are worse performing in some regard (speed, accuracy, memory, etc.). The second claimed contribution is the use of batch normalization (BN) in their network architecture. There is a case to be made that BN hasn't been explored in Fast R-CNN. However, if the goal of the paper was to thoroughly explore BN + Fast R-CNN, then why focus narrowly on pedestrian detection? Instead, it should focus more broadly on generic object category detection for which there are well established Fast R-CNN baselines on PASCAL VOC and COCO. The use of BN + Fast R-CNN only for pedestrian detection does not provide much signal about this choice. There are also potential technical issues that are not discussed. BN is typically avoided in Fast R-CNN because the batch size seen by most of the network is usually only one or two images. This is likely too few images for the naive application of BN.

They use “EdgeBoxes” object proposals and incorporate batch norm into their network. Results are shown on the INRIA and ETH pedestrian datasets. They are reasonable but not state-of-the-art. Results are not shown on Caltech Pedestrians, the standard modern dataset used to evaluate pedestrian detection. Perhaps more importantly, the paper has no novelty.

The detection system described in this paper is a standard application of Fast RCNN to pedestrian detection. The implementation is not state-of-the-art, and there is no novelty in this work.

1028,False,A Neural Knowledge Language Model,"This paper addresses the practical problem of generating rare or unseen words in the context of language modeling. Since language follows a Zipf’s law, most approaches limit the vocabulary (because of computation reasons) and hence rare words are often mapped to a UNK token. Rare words are especially important in context of applications such as question answering. MT etc. This paper proposes a language modeling technique which incorporates facts from knowledge bases (KBs) and thus has the ability to generate (potentially unseen) words from KBs. This paper also releases a dataset by aligning words with Freebase facts and corresponding Wikipedia descriptions.

The model first selects a KB fact based on the previously generated words and facts. Based on the selected fact, it then predicts whether to generate a word based on the vocabulary or to output a symbolic word from the KB. For the latter, the model is trained to predict the position of the word from the fact description.

Overall the paper could use some rewriting especially the notations in section 3. The experiments are well executed and they definitely get good results. The heat maps at the end are very insightful. 

Comments

This contributions of this paper would be much stronger if it showed improvements in a practical applications such as Question Answering (although the paper clearly mentions that this technique could be applied to improve QA)
In section 3, it is unclear why the authors refer the entity as a ‘topic'. This makes the text a little confusing since a topic can also be associated with something abstract, but in this case the topic is always a freebase entity. 
Is it really necessary to predict a fact at every step before generating a word. In other words, how many distinct facts on average does the model choose to generate a sentence. Intuitively a natural language sentence would be describe few facts about an entity. If the fact generation step could be avoided (by adding a latent variable which decides if the fact should be generated or not), the model will also be faster.
In equation 2, the model has to make a hard decision to choose the fact. For this to be end to end trained, every word needs to be annotated with a corresponding fact which might not be always a realistic scenario. For e.g., in domains such as social media text.
Learning position embeddings for copying knowledge words seems a little counter-intuitive. Does the sequence of knowledge words follow any particular structure like word O_2 is always the last name (e.g. Obama).
It would also be nice to compare to char-level LM's which inherently solves the unknown token problem.",,6.0,3.0
1029,False,A Neural Knowledge Language Model,"This paper proposes to incorporate knowledge base facts into language modeling, thus at each time step, a word is either generated from the full vocabulary or relevant KB entities.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness on a new generated dataset WikiFacts which aligns Wikipedia articles with Freebase facts.  The authors also suggest a modified perplexity metric which penalizes the likelihood of unknown words.

At a high level, I do like the motivation of this paper -- named entity words are usually important for downstream tasks, but difficult to learn solely based on statistical co-occurrences. The facts encoded in KB could be a great supply for this.

However, I find it difficult to follow the details of the paper (mainly Section 3) and think the paper writing needs to be much improved. 
- I cannot find where  f_{symbkey} / f_{voca} / f_{copy} are defined
- w^v, w^s are confusing.
- e_k seems to be the average of all previous fact embeddings? It is necessary to make it clear enough.
- (h_t, c_t) = f_LSTM(x_{t−1}, h_{t−1})  c_t is not used?
- The notion of “fact embeddings” is also not that clear (I understand that they are taken as the concatenation of relation and entity (object) entities in the end).  For the anchor / “topic-itself” facts, do you learn the embedding for the special relations and use the entity embeddings from TransE?

On generating words from KB entities (fact description), it sounds a bit strange to me to generate a symbol position first.  Most entities are multiple words, and it is necessary to keep that order. Also it might be helpful to incorporate some prior information, for example, it is common to only mention “Obama” for the entity “Barack Obama”?

1030,False,A Neural Knowledge Language Model,"The paper proposes an evolution upon traditional Recurrent Language Models to give the capability to deal with unknown words. It is done by pairing the traditional RNNLM with a module operating on a KB and able to copy from KB facts to generate unseen words. It is shown to be efficient and much better than plain RNNLM on a new dataset.

The writing could be improved. The beginning of Section 3 in particular is hard to parse.

There have been similar efforts recently (like ""Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models"" by Merity et al.) that attempt to overcome limitations of RNNLMs with unknown words; but they usually do it by adding a mechanism to copy from a longer past history. The proposal of the current paper is different and more interesting to me in that it try to bring knowledge from another source (KB) to the language model. This is harder because one needs to leverage the large scale of the KB to do so. Being able to train that conveniently is nice.

The architecture appears sound, but the writing makes it hard to fully understand completely so I can not give a higher rating. 


Other comments:
* How to cope with the dependency on the KB? Freebase is not updated anymore so it is likely that a lot of the new unseen words in the making are not going to be in Freebase.
* What is the performance on standard benchmarks like Penn Tree Bank?
* How long is it to train compare to a standard RNNLM?
* What is the importance of the knowledge context $e$?
* How is initialized the fact embedding $a_{t-1}$ for the first word?
* When a word from a fact description has been chosen as prediction (copied), how is it encoded in the generation history for following predictions if it has no embedding (unknown word)? In other words, what happens if ""Michelle"" in the example of Section 3.1 is not in the embedding dictionary, when one wants to predict the next word?

1031,True,Learning Visual Servoing with Deep Features and Fitted Q-Iteration,"The paper proposes a novel approach for learning visual servoing based on Q-iteration. The main contributions of the paper are:

1. Bilinear dynamics model for predicting next frame (features) based on action and current frame
2. Formulation of servoing with a Q-function that learns weights for different feature channels
3. An elegant method for optimizing the Bellman error to learn the Q-function

Pros:
+ The paper does a good job of exploring different ways to connect the action (u_t) and frame representation (y_t) to predict next frame features (y_{t+1}). They argue in favour of a locally connected bilinear model which strikes the balance between computation and expressive ability. 

Cons:
- While, sec. 4 makes good arguments for different choices, I would have liked to see more experimental results comparing the 3 approaches: fully connected, convolutional and locally connected dynamics.

Pros: 
+ The idea of weighting different channels to capture the importance of obejcts in different channels seems more effective than treating errors across all channels equally. This is also validated experimentally, where unweighted performance suffers consistently.
+ Solving the Bellman error is a difficult problem in Q-learning approaches. The current paper presents a solid optimization scheme based on the key-observation that scaling Q-function parameters does not affect the best policy chosen. This enables a more elegant FQI approach as opposed to typical optimization schemes which (c_t + \gamma min_u Q_{t+1}) fixed. 

Cons:
- However, I would have liked to see the difference between FQI and such an iterative approach which holds the second term in Eq. 5 fixed.

Experimental results:
- Overall, I find the experimental results unsatisfying given the small scale and toy simulations. However, the lack of benchmarks in this domain needs to be recognized.
- Also, as pointed out in pre-review section, the idea of modifying the VGG needs to be experimentally validated. In its current form, it is not clear whether the modified VGG would perform better than the original version.

Overall, the contribution of the paper is solid in terms of technical novelty and problem formulations. However, the paper could use stronger experiments as suggested to earlier to bolster its claims.

1032,True,Learning Visual Servoing with Deep Features and Fitted Q-Iteration,"This paper investigates the benefits of visual servoing using a learned
visual representation. The authors  propose to first learn an action-conditional
bilinear model of the visual features (obtained from a pre-trained VGG net) from
which a policy can be derived using a linearization of the dynamics. A multi-scale,
multi-channel and locally-connected variant of the bilinear model is presented.
Since the bilinear model only predicts the dynamics one step ahead, the paper
proposes a weighted objective which incorporates the long-term values of the
current policy. The evaluation problem is addressed using a fitted-value approach.

The paper is well written, mathematically solid, and conceptually exhaustive.
The experiments also demonstrate the benefits of using a value-weighted objective
and is an important contribution of this paper. This paper also seems to be the
first to outline a trust-region fitted-q iteration algorithm. The use of
pre-trained visual features is also shown to help, empirically, for generalization.

Overall, I recommend this paper as it would benefit many researchers in robotics.
However, in the context of this conference, I find the contribution specifically on
the ""representation"" problem to be limited. It shows that a pre-trained VGG
representation is useful, but does not consider learning it end-to-end. This is not
to say that it should be end-to-end, but proportionally speaking, the paper
spends more time on the control problem than the representation learning one.
Also, the policy representation is fixed and the values are approximated
in linear form using problem-specific features. This doesn't make the paper
less valuable, but perhaps less aligned with what I think ICLR should be about.

1033,True,Learning Visual Servoing with Deep Features and Fitted Q-Iteration,"1) Summary

This paper proposes to tackle visual servoing (specifically target following) using spatial feature maps from convolutional networks pre-trained on general image classification tasks. The authors combine bilinear models of one-step dynamics of visual feature maps at multiple scales with a reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a servoing policy. This policy is learned by minimizing a regularized weighted average of distances to features predicted by the aforementioned model of visual dynamics.

2) Contributions

+ Controlled experiments in simulation quantifying the usefulness of pre-trained deep features for visual servoing.
+ Clear performance benefits with respect to many sensible baselines, including ones using ground truth bounding boxes.
+ Principled learning of multi-scale visual feature weights with an efficient trust-region fitted Q-iteration algorithm to handle the problem of distractors.
+ Good sample efficiency thanks to the choice of Q-function approximator and the model-based one-step visual feature dynamics.
+ Open source virtual city environment to benchmark visual servoing.

3) Suggestions for improvement

- More complex benchmark:
Although the environment is not just a toy synthetic one, the experiments would benefit greatly from more complex visual conditions (clutter, distractors, appearance and motion variety, environment richness and diversity, etc). At least, the realism and diversity of object appearances could be vastly improved by using a larger number of 3D car models, including more realistic and diverse ones that can be obtained from Google SketchUp for instance, and populating the environment with more distractor cars (in traffic or parked). This is important as the main desired quality of the approach is robustness to visual variations.

- End-to-end and representation learning:
Although the improvements are already significant in the current synthetic experiments, it would be interesting to measure the impact of end-to-end training (i.e. also fine-tuning the convnet), as it is possibly needed for better generalization in more challenging visual conditions. It would also allow to measure the benefit of deep representation learning for visual servoing, which would be relevant to ICLR (there is no representation learning so far, although the method can be straightforwardly adapted as the authors mention briefly).

- Reproducibility:
The formalism and algorithms are clearly explained, but there is a slightly overwhelming mass of practical tricks and implementation details described with varying levels of details throughout the paper and appendix. Grouping, simplifying, or reorganizing the exposition of these implementation details would help, but a better way would probably consist in only summarizing the most important ones in section and link to an open source implementation of the method for completeness.

- Typos:
p.2: ""learning is a relative[ly] recent addition""
p.2: ""be applied [to] directly learn""

In spite of the aforementioned limits of the experiments, this paper is interesting and solid, in part thanks to the excellent reply to the pre-review questions and the subsequent improved revision.

One question on Sec. 3.3, to build the DMTRL, one DNN per-task is trained with the same architecture. How important is this pretraining? Would random initialization also work here? If the data is unbalanced, namely, some classes have very few examples, how would that affect the model?

The authors introduce a general-purpose mechanism to scale up neural networks significantly beyond their current size using sparsity of activation, i.e. by forcing the activation of most neurons in the net to be zero for any given training example.

Firstly, I believe the sheer size of the models successfully trained in this paper warrant an 8 rating all by themselves.

Secondly, we know historically that sparsity of parameters is among the most important modelling principles in machine learning, being used with great success in e.g. Lasso with the l1 penalty, in SVM with the hinge loss and in ConvNets by setting connections outside the receptive field to zero. This paper, in addition to sparsity of parameters (neurons in different experts are not connected) employs sparsity of activation, where the computation path is customized for each training example. It is, as far as I can tell, the first paper to implement this in a practical, scalable and general way for neural networks. If sparsity of activation turns out to be even a small fraction as important as sparsity of parameters, this paper will have a major impact.

Thirdly, I love the computational efficiency of the model presented. The authors achieve extreme sparsity yet fully utilize their GPUs. In particular, the authors design the network in such a way that there are very few connections between active and non-active units. If we have, say, a sparsely activated fully-connected network, most computation would be wasted on network connections that start on active units and end on non-active units.

Fourthly, the authors discuss and provide a practical and elegant strategy for large-scale cluster implementation, showcasing their technical sophistication.

It is perhaps unfortunate that current baseline datasets may not even be able to fully utilize the power of MoE or other to-be-designed networks following similar principles, but models like the one presented here are bound to only become more prominent in the future.

1043,True, Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer,"This paper proposes a method for significantly increasing the number of parameters in a single layer while keeping computation in par with (or even less than) current SOTA models. The idea is based on using a large mixture of experts (MoE) (i.e. small networks), where only a few of them are adaptively activated via a gating network. While the idea seems intuitive, the main novelty in the paper is in designing the gating network which is encouraged to achieve two objectives: utilizing all available experts (aka importance), and distributing computation fairly across them (aka load). 
Additionally, the paper introduces two techniques for increasing the batch-size passed to each expert, and hence maximizing parallelization in GPUs.
Experiments applying the proposed approach on RNNs in language modelling task show that it can beat SOTA results with significantly less computation, which is a result of selectively using much more parameters. Results on machine translation show that a model with more than 30x number of parameters can beat SOTA while incurring half of the effective computation.

- I believe that the authors can do a better job in their presentation. The paper currently is at 11 pages (which is too long in my opinion), but I find that Section 3.2 (the crux of the paper) needs better motivation and intuitive explanation. For example, equation 8 deserves more description than currently devoted to it. Additional space can be easily regained by moving details in the experiments section (e.g. architecture and training details) to the appendix for the curious readers. Experiment section can be better organized by finishing on experiment completely before moving to the other one. There are also some glitches in the writing, e.g. the end of Section 3.1. 
- The paper is missing some important references in conditional computation (e.g. ",,7.0,4.0
1044,True, Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer,"This paper describes a method for greatly expanding network model size (in terms of number of stored parameters) in the context of a recurrent net, by applying a Mixture of Experts between recurrent net layers that is shared between all time steps.  By process features from all timesteps at the same time, the effective batch size to the MoE is increased by a factor of the number of steps in the model; thus even for sparsely assigned experts, each expert can be used on a large enough sub-batch of inputs to remain computationally efficient.  Another second technique that redistributes elements within a distributed model is also described, further increasing per-expert batch sizes.

Experiments are performed on language modeling and machine translation tasks, showing significant gains by increasing the number of experts, compared to both SoA as well as explicitly computationally-matched baseline systems.

An area that falls a bit short is in presenting plots or statistics on the real computational load and system behavior.  While two loss terms were employed to balance the use of experts, these are not explored in the experiments section.  It would have been nice to see the effects of these more, along with the effects of increasing effective batch sizes, e.g. measurements of the losses over the course of training, compared to the counts/histogram distributions of per-expert batch sizes.

Overall I think this is a well-described system that achieves good results, using a nifty placement for the MoE that can overcome what otherwise might be a disadvantage for sparse computation.

1045,True,Capacity and Trainability in Recurrent Neural Networks,"The authors investigate a variety of existing and two new RNN architectures to obtain more insight about the effectiveness at which these models can store task information in their parameters and activations.

The experimental setups look sound. To generalize comparisons between different architectures it’s necessary to consider multiple tasks and control for the effect of the hyperparameters. This work uses multiple tasks of varying complexities, principled hyperparameter tuning methodology and a number of tuning iterations that can currently only be achieved by the computational resources of some of the larger industrial research groups. 

The descriptions of the models and the objective where very clear to me. The descriptions of the experiments and presentation of the results were not always clear to me at times, even with the additional details in the appendix available. Most of these issues can easily be resolved by editing the text. For example, in the memory task the scaling of the inputs (and hence also outputs) is not provided so it’s hard to interpret the squared error scores in Figure 2c. It’s not clear to me what the term ‘unrollings’ refers to in Figure 2b. Is this a time lag with additional hidden state updates between the presentation of the input sequence and the generation of the output? Since the perceptron capacity task is somewhat central to the paper, I think a slightly more precise description of how and when the predictions are computed would be helpful. Due to the large number of graphs, it can be somewhat hard to find the most relevant results. Perhaps some of the more obvious findings (like Figure 1(b-d) given Figure 1a) could move to the appendix to make space for more detailed task descriptions.

Novelty is not really the aim of this paper since it mostly investigates existing architectures. To use the mutual information to obtain bits per parameter scores in highly non-linear parameterized functions is new to me. The paper also proposed to new architectures that seem to have practical value. The paper adds to the currently still somewhat neglected research effort to employ the larger computational resources we currently have towards a better understanding of architectures which were designed when such resources were not yet available. I’d argue that the paper is original enough for that reason alone.

The paper provides some interesting new insights into the properties of RNNs. While observed before, it is interesting to see the importance of gated units for maintaining trainability of networks with many layers. It is also interesting to see a potential new use for vanilla RNNs for simpler tasks where a high capacity per parameter may be required due to hardware constraints. The proposed +RNN may turn out to have practical value as well and the hyperparameter robustness results shed some light on the popularity of certain architectures when limited time for HP tuning is available. The large body of results and hyperparameter analysis should be useful to many researchers who want to use RNNs in the future. All in all, I think this paper would make a valuable addition to the ICLR conference but would benefit from some improvements to the text.

* The insistence on a strong distinction between capacity and trainability helps nicely clear up a misconception about the reasons why gated architectures work.  In sum, they're much more easily trainable but somewhat lower capacity than vanilla RNNs, and in hard tasks, the benefits of better trainability far outweigh the costs of mildly lower capacity.

* The point about the near-equivalence of capacity at equal numbers of parameters is very useful.   

* The paper makes it clear the importance of HP tuning, something that has sometimes gotten lost in the vast flow of papers about new architectures.

* The work on the UGRNNs and the +RNNs seems a bit preliminary.  I don't think that the authors have clearly shown that the +RNN should be ""recommended"" with the same generality as the GRU.   I'd at the least want some better statistics on the significance of differences between +RNN and GRU performances quantifying the results in Figure 4 (8-layer panel).   In a way the high standards for declaring an architecture useful that are set in the paper make the UGRNNs and +RNN contributions seem less important.   I don't really mind having them in the paper though.   I guess the point of this paper is not really to be novel in the first place -- which is totally fine with me, though I don't know what the ICLR area chairs will think. 

* The paper gives short shrift to the details of the HP algorithm itself.  They do say: 

     ""Our setting of the tuner’s internal parameters was such that it uses Batched GP Bandits with an expected improvement acquisition function and a   
     Matern 5/2 Kernel with feature scaling and automatic relevance determination performed by optimizing over kernel HPs""  

and give some good references, but I expect that actually trying to replicate this involves a lot of missing details.   

* I found some of the figures a bit hard to read at first, esp. Fig 4, mostly due to the panels being small, having a lot of details, and bad choices for visual cleanliness.   

* The neuroscience reference (""4.7 bits per synapse"") seems a little bit of a throw-away to me, because the connection between these results and the experimental neuroscience is very tenuous, or at any rate, not well explained.  I guess it's just in the discussion, but it seems gratuitous.   Maybe it should couched in slightly less strong terms (nothing is really strongly shown to be ""in agreement"" here between computational architectures and neuroscience, but perhaps they could say something like -- ""We wonder if it is anything other than coincidence that our 5 bits result is numerically similar to the 4.7 bits measurement from neuroscience."")

1047,True,Capacity and Trainability in Recurrent Neural Networks,"CONTRIBUTIONS
Large-scale experiments are used to measure the capacity and trainability of different RNN architectures. Capacity experiments suggest that across all architectures, RNNs can store between three and six bits of information per parameter, with ungated RNNs having the highest per-parameter capacity. All architectures are able to store approximately one floating point number per hidden unit. Trainability experiments show that ungated architectures (RNN, IRNN) are much harder to train than gated architectures (GRU, LSTM, UGRNN, +RNN). The paper also proposes two novel RNN architectures (UGRNN and +RNN); experiments suggest that the UGRNN has similar per-parameter capacity as the ungated RNN but is much easier to train, and that deep (8-layer) +RNN models are easier to train than existing architectures.

CLARITY
The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

NOVELTY
This paper is the first to my knowledge to empirically measure the number of bits of information that can be stored per learnable parameter. The idea of measuring network capacity by finding the dataset size and other hyperparameters that maximizes mutual information is a particularly novel experimental setup.

The proposed UGRNN is similar but not identical to the minimal gated unit proposed by Zhou et al, “Minimal Gated Unit for Recurrent Neural Networks”, International Journal of Automation and Computing, 2016.

SIGNIFICANCE
I have mixed feelings about the significance of this paper. I found the experiments interesting, but I don’t feel that they reveal anything particularly surprising or unexpected about recurrent networks; it is hard to see how any of the experimental results will change the way either that I think about RNNs, or the way that I will use them in my own future work. On the other hand it is valuable to see intuitive results about RNNs confirmed by rigorous experiments, especially since few researchers have the computational resources to perform such large-scale experiments.

The capacity experiments (both per-parameter capacity and per-unit capacity) essentially force the network to model random data. For most applications of RNNs, however, we do not expect them to work with random data; instead when applied in machine translation or language modeling or image captioning or any number of real-world tasks, we hope that RNNs can learn to model data that is anything but random. It is not clear to me that an architecture’s ability to model random data should be beneficial in modeling real-world data; indeed, the experiments in Section 2.1 show that architectures vary in their capacity to model random data, but the text8 experiments in Section 3 show that these same architectures do not significantly vary in their capacity to model real-world data.

I do not think that the experimental results in the paper are sufficient to prove the significance of the proposed UGRNN and +RNN architectures. It is interesting that the UGRNN can achieve comparable bits per parameter as the ungated RNN and that the deep +RNNs are more easily trainable than other architectures, but the only experiments on a real-world task (language modeling on text8) do not show these architectures to be significantly better than GRU or LSTM.

SUMMARY
I wish that the experiments had revealed more surprising insights about RNNs, though there is certainly value in experimentally verifying intuitive results. The proposed UGRNN and +RNN architectures show some promising results on synthetic tasks, but I wish that they showed more convincing performance on real-world tasks. Overall I think that the good outweighs the bad, and that the ideas of this paper are of value to the community.

PROS
- The paper is the first of my knowledge to explicitly measure the bits per parameter that RNNs can store
- The paper experimentally confirms several intuitive ideas about RNNs:
    - RNNs of any architecture can store about one number per hidden unit from the input
    - Different RNN architectures should be compared by their parameter count, not their hidden unit count
    - With very careful hyperparameter tuning, all RNN architectures perform about the same on text8 language modeling
    - Gated architectures are easier to train than non-gated RNNs

CONS
- Experiments do not reveal anything particularly surprising or unexpected
- The UGRNN and +RNN architectures do not feel well-motivated
- The utility of the UGRNN and +RNN architectures is not well-established",,7.0,4.0

1049,False,Information Dropout: learning optimal representations through noise,"Paper summary
This paper develops a generalization of dropout using information theoretic
principles. The basic idea is that when learning a representation z of input x
with the aim of predicting y, we must choose a z such that it carries the least
amount of information about x, as long as it can predict y. This idea can be
formalized using the Information Bottleneck Lagrangian. This leads to an
optimization problem which is similar to the one derived for variational
dropout, the difference being that Information dropout allows for a scaling
factor associated with the KL divergence term that encourages noise. The amount
of noise being added is made a parameterized function of the data and this
function is optimized along with the rest of the model. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and MNIST show (small) improvements over binary dropout.

Strengths
- The paper highlights an important conceptual link between probabilistic
  variational methods and information theoretic methods, showing that dropout
can be generalized using both formalisms to arrive at very similar models.
- The presentation of the model is excellent.
- The experimental results on cluttered MNIST are impressive.

Weaknesses
- The results on CIFAR-10 in Figure 3(b) seem to be on a validation set (unless
  the axis label is a typo). It is not clear why the test set was not used. This
makes it hard to compare to results reported in Springenberg et al, as well as
other results in literature.

Quality
The theoretical exposition is high quality. Figure 2 gives a nice qualitative
assessment of what the model is doing. However, the experimental results
section can be made better, for example, by matching the results on CIFAR-10 as
reported in Springenberg et al. and trying to improve on those using information
dropout.

Clarity
The paper is well written and easy to follow.

Originality
The derivation of the information dropout optimization problem using IB
Lagrangian is novel. However, the final model is quite close to variational
dropout.

Significance
This paper will be of general interest to researchers in representation learning
because it highlights an alternative way to think about latent variables (as
information bottlenecks). However, unless the model can be shown to achieve
significant improvements over simple dropout, its wider impact is likely to be
limited.

Overall
The paper presents an insightful theoretical derivation and good preliminary
results. The experimental section can be improved.

- expecially -> especially
- trough -> through
- There is probably a minus sign missing in the expression for H(y|z) above Eq (2).
- Figure 3(a) has error bars, but 3(b) doesn't. It might be a good idea to have those
for Figure 3(b) as well.
- Please consider comparing Figure 2 with the activity map of a standard CNN
  trained with binary dropout, so we can see if similar filtering out is
happening there already.",,6.0,4.0
1050,False,Information Dropout: learning optimal representations through noise,"An interesting connection is made between dropout, Tishby et al's ""information bottleneck"" and VAEs. Specifically, classification of 'y' from 'x' is split in two faces: an inference model z ~ q(z|x), a prior p(z), and a classifier y ~ p(y|z). By optimizing the objective E_{(x,y)~data} [ E_{z~q(z|x)}[log p(x|y)] + lambda * KL(q(z|x)||p(z))], with lambda <= 1, an information bottleneck 'z' is formed, where lambda controls an upper bound on the number of bits traveling through 'z'.

The objective is equivalent to a VAE objective with downweighted KL(posterior|prior), an encoder that takes as input 'x', and a decoder that only predicts 'x'.

- Related work (section 2) is discussed sufficiently. 
- In section 3, would be better to remind us the definition of mutual information.
- Connection to VAEs in section 5 is interesting.
- Unfortunately, the MNIST/CIFAR-10 results are not great. Since the method is potentially more flexible than other forms of dropout, this is slightly disappointing.
- It's unclear why the CIFAR-10 results seem to be substantially worse than the results originally reported for that architecture.
- It's unclear which version of 'beta' was used in figure 3a.

1051,True,Entropy-SGD: Biasing Gradient Descent Into Wide Valleys,"The paper introduces a new regularization term which encourages the optimizer 
to search for a flat local minimum of reasonably low loss instead of seeking a 
sharp region of a low loss. This is motivated by some empirical observations that
local minima of good generalization performance tend to have flat shape. 
To achieve this, a regularization term based on the free local energy is proposed
and the gradient of this term, which do not have tractable closed-form solution, 
is obtained by performing Monte Carlo estimation using SGLD sampler. In the 
experiments, the authors show some evidence of the flatness of good local 
minima, and also the performance of the proposed method in comparison to the
Adam optimizer. 

The paper is well and clearly written. I enjoyed reading the paper. The connection
to the concept of free energy in optimization framework seems interesting. The 
motivation of pursuing flatness is also well analyzed with a few experiments. I'm
wondering if the first term in eqn. (8) is correct. I guess it should be f(x') not f(x)?
Also, I'm wondering why the authors did not add the experiment results on RNN in
the evaluation of the performance because char-lstm for text generation was 
already used for the flatness experiments. I think adding more experiments on 
various models and applications of deep architectures (e.g., RNN, seq2seq, etc.) 
will make the author's claim more persuasive. I also found the mixed usage of the
terminology, e.g., free energy and free entropy, a bit confusing. 
",,7.0,4.0
1052,True,Entropy-SGD: Biasing Gradient Descent Into Wide Valleys,"This paper presents a principled approach to finding flat minima. The motivation to seek such minima is due to their better generalization ability. The idea is to add to the original loss function a new term that exploits both width and depth of the objective function. In fact, the regularization term can be interpreted as Gaussian convolution of the exponentiated loss. Therefore, the introduced regularization term is essentially Gaussian smoothed version of the exponentiated loss. The smoothing obviously tends to suppress sharp minima.

Overall, developing such regularization term based on thermodynamics concepts is very interesting. I have a couple of concerns that the authors may want to clarify in the rebuttal.

1. When reporting the generalization performance, the experiments report the number of epochs; showing the proposed algorithm reaches better generalization in fewer epochs than plain SGD. Is this the number of epochs it takes by line 7 of your algorithm, or it is the total number of epochs (line 3 and 7 all combined)? If the former, it is not a fair comparison. If you multiply the number of epochs of SGD (line 7) by the number iterations it takes to approximate Langevin dynamics, it seems you obtain little gain against plain SGD.

2. The proposed algorithm approximates the smoothed ""exponentiated"" loss (by smoothing I refer to convolution with the Gaussian). I am wondering how it compares against simpler idea of smoothing the original loss (dropping exponentiation)? Is the difference only in the motivation (e.g. thermodynamics interpretation) or it is deeper, e.g. the proposed scheme lends itself to more accurate approximation and/or achieves better generalization bound (in terms of the attained smoothness)? Smoothing the cost function without exponentiation allows simpler approximation (Monte Carlo integration instead of MCMC), e.g. see section 5.3 of ",,9.0,3.0
1053,True,Entropy-SGD: Biasing Gradient Descent Into Wide Valleys,"I agree with the motivations of the method, but this paper seems to be mostly re-inventing stochastic variational inference.  The SVI ELBO estimate also encourages the approximate posterior mean to head in directions that have high likelihood times volume.

More broadly, the marginal likelihood is also trying to achieve the same tradeoffs, which is the motivation for MCMC methods such as SGLD in the first place.  So It seems bizarre that you would compare Adam against a complicated method with SGLD in the inner loop, without comparing against the much simpler SGLD as well.

Finally, it's frustrating that you discuss free energy and entropy at length in words without giving their precise definitions.  If you did so, I suspect it would become clear that you're proposing maximizing the marginal likelihood, which is definitely a great idea but already well-known.  How does the entropy you optimize relate to the marginal likelihood and the variational ELBO?",,,

1056,False,Exploring LOTS in Deep Neural Networks,"This paper proposes the Layerwise Origin Target Synthesis (LOTS) method, which entails computing a difference in representation at a given layer in a neural network and then projecting that difference back to input space using backprop. Two types of differences are explored: linear scalings of a single input’s representation and difference vectors between representations of two inputs, where the inputs are of different classes.

In the former case, the LOTS method is used as a visualization of the representation of a specific input example, showing what it would mean, in input space, for the feature representation to be supressed or magnified. While it’s an interesting computation to perform, the value of the visualizations is not very clear.

In the latter case, LOTS is used to generate adversarial examples, moving from an origin image just far enough toward a target image to cause the classification to flip. As expected, the changes required are smaller when LOTS targets a higher layer (in the limit of targetting the last layer, results similar to the original adversarial image results would be obtained).

The paper is an interesting basic exploration and would probably be a great workshop paper. However, the results are probably not quite compelling enough to warrant a full ICLR paper.

A few suggestions for improvement:
 - Several times it is claimed that LOTS can be used as a method for mining for diverse adversarial examples that could be used in training classifiers more robust to adversarial perturbation. But this simple experiment of training on LOTS generated examples isn’t tried. Showing whether the LOTS method outperforms, say, FGS would go a long way toward making a strong paper.
 - How many layers are in the networks used in the paper, and what is their internal structure? This isn’t stated anywhere. I was left wondering whether, say, in Fig 2 the CONV2_1 layer was immediately after the CONV1_1 layer and whether the FC8 layer was the last layer in the network.
 - In Fig 1, 2, 3, and 4, results of the application of LOTS are shown for many intermediate layers but miss for some reason applying it to the input (data) layer and the output/classification (softmax) layer. Showing the full range of possible results would reinforce the interpreatation (for example, in Fig 3, are even larger perturbations necessary in pixel space vs CONV1 space? And does operating directly in softmax space result in smaller perturbations than IP2?)
 - The PASS score is mentioned a couple times but never explained at all. E.g. Fig 1 makes use of it but does not specify such basics as whether higher or lower PASS scores are associated with more or less severe perturbations. A basic explanation would be great.
 - 4.2 states “In summary, the visualized internal feature representations of the origin suggest that lower convolutional layers of the VGG Face model have managed to learn and capture features that provide semantically meaningful and interpretable representations to human observers.” I don’t see that this follows from any results. If this is an important claim to the paper, it should be backed up by additional arguments or results.

I have a question about eq. 3 and 4.

In eq. (3) and (4) you \eta compute gradient of f_{w}^{l} (x) over input x, which I would expect to be Jacobian matrix with size d_l*n (where n - dimensionality of input x). So looking at eq (3) and (4) I would expect that \eta and x has different dimensionality. At the same time in section 4 you add s*\eta to x.
Could you explain this discrepancy in dimensionality and how \eta should be calculated?

It’s not clear that some of the statements at the beginning of Sec 4.1 are actually true, re: positive/negative signs and how that changes (or does not change) the class.

1060,False,Fuzzy paraphrases in learning word representations with a lexicon,"This paper introduces the concept of fuzzy paraphrases to aid in the learning of distributed word representations from a corpus augmented by a lexicon or ontology. Sometimes polysemy is context-dependent, but prior approaches have neglected this fact when incorporating external paraphrase information during learning. The main idea is to introduce a function that essentially judges the context-sensitivity of paraphrase candidates, down-weighting those candidates that depend strongly on context. This function is inferred from bilingual translation agreement.

The main argumentation leading to the model selection is intuitive, and I believe that the inclusion of good paraphrases and the elimination of bad paraphrases during training should in principle improve word representation quality. However, the main questions are how well the proposed method achieves this goal, and, even if it achieves it well, whether it makes much difference in practical terms.

Regarding the first question, I am not entirely convinced that the parameterization of the control function f(x_ij) is optimal. It would have been nice to see some experiments investigating different choices, in particular some baselines where the effect of f is diminished (so that it reduces to f=1 in the limit) would have been interesting. I also feel like there would be a lot to gain from having f be a function of the nearby word embeddings, though this would obvious incur a significant slowdown. (See for example 'Efficient Non-parametric Estimation of Multiple Embeddings per Word in Vector Space' by Neelakantan et al, which should probably be cited.) As it stands, the experimental results do not clearly distinguish the fuzzy paraphrase approach from prior work, i.e. tables 3 and 4 do not show major trends one way or the other.

Regarding the second question, it is hard to draw many conclusions from analogy tasks alone, especially when effects unrelated to good/bad paraphrasing such as corpus size/content, window size, vocabulary size, etc., can have an outsize effect on performance.

The evaluation does not convincingly determine whether the model is a significant improvement over simpler methods (particularly those that do not require the paraphrase database!). Likewise, the model section did not convince me that this was the most obvious model formulation to try.

The paper presents a method for hierarchical RL using stochastic neural networks. The paper has introduced using information-theoretic measure of option identifiability as an additional reward for learning a diverse mixture of sub-policies. One nice result in the paper is the comparison with strong baseline which directly combines the intrinsic rewards with sparse rewards and shows that this supposedly smooth reward can’t solve tasks. Besides the argument made from the authors on difficulty on long-term credit assignment/benefits from hierarchical abstraction, one possible explanation for this might be the diversity requirement imposed in sub-policy training, which is assumed to be off in the baseline case. Wonder if this can shed insights into improving the baseline and proposing new end-to-end hierarchical policy learning as hierarchical REPS/option-critic etc. papers do. Nice visualizations.

The paper presents a promising direction, and it may be strengthened further by possibly addressing some of the following points. 

1) Limited diversification of sub-policies: Both concatenation and bilinear integration allow only minimal differentiations in sub-policies through first hidden weight, which is not a problem in the tested tasks because they essentially require same locomotion policies with minimal diversification, but such limitation can be more obvious in other tasks where ideal sub-policies are more diverse. Thus it is interesting to see it apply on harder, non-locomotion domains, where ideal sub-policies are not that similar, e.g. for manipulation, solving some task from one state can be very different from solving it from another state. 

2) Limitation on hierarchical policies: Manager network is trained while the sub-policies are fixed. Furthermore, the time steps for sub-policies are fixed. This requires “intrinsic” rewards and their learned sub-policies to be very good for solving down-stream tasks. It would be nice to see some more discussions/results on handling such cases, ideally connecting to end-to-end hierarchical policy learning.

3) Intrinsic/unsupervised rewards seem domain-specific/supervised rewards: Because of (2), this seems unavoidable.

The conclusions are that ResNets behave as an ensemble of shallow networks at the start of training (by examining the magnitude of the weights for paths of a specific length) but this changes through training, through which the scaling parameter C (from assumption A4) increases, causing it to behave as an ensemble of deeper and deeper networks.

Clarity:
This paper was somewhat difficult to follow, being heavy in notation, with perhaps some notation overloading. A summary of some of the proofs in the main text might have been helpful.

Specific Comments:
- In the proof of Lemma 2, I'm not sure where the sequence beta comes from (I don't see how it follows from 11?)

- The ResNet structure used in the paper is somewhat different from normal with multiple layers being skipped? (Can the same analysis be used if only one layer is skipped? It seems like the skipping mostly affects the number of paths there are of a certain length?)

- The new experiments supporting the scale increase in practice are interesting! I'm not sure about Theorems 3, 4 necessarily proving this link theoretically however, particularly given the simplifying assumption at the start of Section 4.2?",,7.0,3.0

This paper extend the Spin Glass analysis of Choromanska et al. (2015a) to Res Nets which yield the novel dynamic ensemble results for Res Nets and the connection to Batch Normalization and the analysis of their loss surface of Res Nets.

The paper is well-written with many insightful explanation of results. Although the technical contributions extend the Spin Glass model analysis of the ones by Choromanska et al. (2015a), the updated version could eliminate one of the unrealistic assumptions and the analysis further provides novel dynamic ensemble results and the connection to Batch Normalization that gives more insightful results about the structure of Res Nets. 

It is essential to show this dynamic behaviour in a regime without batch normalization to untangle the normalization effect on ensemble feature. Hence authors claim that steady increase in the L_2 norm of the weights will maintain the this feature but setting for Figure 1 is restrictive to empirically support the claim. At least results on CIFAR 10 without batch normalization for showing effect of L_2 norm increase and results that support claims about Theorem 4 would strengthen the paper.

This work provides an initial rigorous framework to analyze better the inherent structure of the current state of art Res Net architectures and its variants which can stimulate potentially more significant results towards careful understanding of current state of art models (Rather than always to attempting to improve the performance of Res Nets by applying intuitive incremental heuristics, it is important to progress on some solid understanding too).",,7.0,3.0

1070,False,Incremental Sequence Learning,"The submitted paper proposes a new way of learning sequence predictors. In the lines of incremental learning and curriculum learning, easier samples are presented first and the complexity is increased during training. The particularity here is that the complexity is defined as the length of the sequences given for training, the premise being is that longer sequences are harder to learn, since they need a more complex internal representation.

The targeted application is sequence prediction from primed prefixes, tested on a single dataset, which the authors extract themselves from MNIST.

The idea in the paper is interesting and worth reading. There are also many interesting aspects of evaluation part, as the authors perform several ablation studies to rule out side-effects of the tests. The proposed learning strategy is compared to other strategies.

However, my biggest concern is still with evaluation. The authors tested the method on a single dataset, which is non standard and derived from MNIST. Given the general nature of the claim, in order to confirm the interest of the proposed algorithm, it need to be tested on other datasets, public datasets, and on a different application.

The paper is too long and should be trimmed significantly.

The transfer learning part (from prediction to classification) is a different story and I do not see a clear connection to the main contribution of the paper.

Although the paper is well written, the experiment section is definitely its dead point. Firstly, although it shows some improvements over traditional LSTMs, those results are not on par with the state of the art. Secondly, if the purpose is to take those extensions as strong baselines for further research, the experiments are not adequate: the both two datasets which were used are quite similar (though they have different statistics).

With that said, I am concerned about the experiments and their results. The residual connections do not seem to consistently help performance; on SST the vertical residuals help but the lateral residuals hurt, and on IMDB it is the opposite. More fundamentally, there need to be more tasks than just sentiment analysis here. I'm not quite sure why the paper's focus is on text classification, as any NLP task using an LSTM encoder could conceivably benefit from these modifications. It would be great to see a huge variety of tasks like QA, MT, etc., which would really make the paper much stronger.

The paper is well written, and easy to understand. It is based on a simple but efficient idea of simultaneously learning the policy and a model of the reward and the resulting algorithm exhibit interesting properties. The proposed idea is quite obvious, but the authors are the first ones to propose to test such a model. The experiments could be made stronger by mixing continuous and discrete problems but are convincing.",,8.0,4.0
1075,True,Generalizing Skills with Semi-Supervised Reinforcement Learning,"This paper formalizes the problem setting of having only a subset of available MDPs for which one has access to a reward. The authors name this setting ""semi-supervised reinforcement learning"" (SSRL), as a reference to semi-supervised learning (where one only has access to labels for a subset of the dataset). They provide an approach for solving SSRL named semi-supervised skill generalization (S3G), which builds on the framework of maximum entropy control. The whole approach is straightforward and amounts to an EM algorithm with partial labels (: they alternate iteratively between estimating a reward function (parametrized) and fitting a control policy using this reward function. They provide experiments on 4 tasks (obstacle, 2-link reacher, 2-link reacher with vision, half-cheetah) in MuJoCo.

The paper is well-written, and is overall clear. The appendix provides some more context, I think a few implementation details are missing to be able to fully reproduce the experiments from the paper, but they will provide the code.

The link to inverse reinforcement learning seems to be done correctly. However, there is no reference to off-policy policy learning, and, for instance, it seems to me that the \tau \in D_{samp} term of equation (3) could benefit from variance reduction as in e.g. TB(\lambda) [Precup et al. 2000] or Retrace(\lambda) [Munos et al. 2016].

The experimental section is convincing, but I would appreciate a precision (and small discussion) of this sentence ""To extensively test the generalization capabilities of the policies learned with each method, we measure performance on a wide range of settings that is a superset of the unlabeled and labeled MDPs"" with numbers for the different scenarios (or the replacement of superset by ""union"" if this is the case). It may explain better the poor results of ""oracle"" on ""obstacle"" and ""2-link reacher"", and reinforce* the further sentences ""In the obstacle task, the true reward function is not sufficiently shaped for learning in the unlabeled MDPs. Hence, the reward regression and oracle methods perform poorly"".

Correction on page 4: ""5-tuple M_i = (S, A, T, R)"" is a 4-tuple.

Overall, I think that this is a good and sound paper. I am personally unsure as to if all the parallels and/or references to previous work are complete, thus my confidence score of 3.

1076,False,Multiplicative LSTM for sequence modelling,"* Brief Summary: 

This paper explores an extension of multiplicative RNNs to the LSTM type of models. The resulting proposal is very similar to [1]. Authors show experimental results on character-level language modeling tasks. In general, I think the paper is well-written and the explanations are quite clear.

* Criticisms:

- In terms of contributions, the paper is weak. The motivation makes sense, however, very similar work has been done in [1] and already an extension over [2]. Because of that this paper mainly stands as an application paper.
- The results are encouraging. On the other hand, they are still behind the state of art without using dynamic evaluation. 
- There are some non-standard choices on modifications on the standard algorithms, such as ""l"" parameter of RMSProp and multiplying output gate before the nonlinearity.
- The experimental results are only limited to character-level language modeling only. 

* An Overview of the Review:

Pros:
- A simple modification that seems to reasonably well in practice.
- Well-written.

Cons:
- Lack of good enough experimental results.
- Not enough contributions (almost trivial extension over existing algorithms).
- Non-standard modifications over the existing algorithms.

1077,False,Multiplicative LSTM for sequence modelling,"This paper proposes an extension of the multiplicative RNN [1] where the authors apply the same reparametrization trick to the weight matrices of the LSTM. 

The paper proposes some interesting tricks, but none of them seems to be very crucial. For instance, in Eq. (16), the authors propose to multiply the output gate inside the activation function in order to alleviate the saturation problem in logistic sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent. Also, the authors share m_t across the inference of different gating units and cell-state candidates, at the end this brings only 1.25 times increase on the number of model parameters. Lastly, the authors use a variant of RMSProp where they add an additional hyper-parameter $\ell$ and schedule it across the training time. It would be nicer to apply the same tricks to other baseline models and show the improvement with regard to each trick.

With the new architectural modification to the LSTM and all the tricks combined, the performance is not as great as we would expect. Why didn’t the authors apply batch normalization, layer normalization or zoneout to their models? Was there any issue with applying one of those regularization or optimization techniques? 

At the fourth paragraph of Section 4.4, where the authors connect dynamic evaluation with fast weights is misleading. I find it a bit hard to connect dynamic evaluation as a variant of fast weights. Fast weights do not use test error signal. In the paper, the authors claim that “dynamic evaluation uses the error signal and gradients to update the weights, which potentially increases its effectiveness, but also limits its scope to conditional generative modelling, when the outputs can be observed after they are predicted”, and I am afraid to tell that this assumption is very misleading. We should never assume that test label information is given at the inference time. The test label information is there to evaluate the generalization performance of the model. In some applications, we may get the label information at test time, e.g., stock prediction, weather forecasting, however, in many other applications, we don’t. For instance, in machine translation, we don't know what's the best translation at the end, unlike weather forecasting. Also, it would be fair to apply dynamic evaluation to all the other baseline models as well to compare with the BPC score 1.19 achieved by the proposed mLSTM.

The quality of the work is not that bad, but the novelty of the paper is not that good either. The performance of the proposed model is oftentime worse than other methods, and it is only better when dynamic evaluation is coupled together. However, dynamic evaluation can improve the other methods as well.

1078,False,CAN AI GENERATE LOVE ADVICE?: TOWARD NEURAL ANSWER GENERATION FOR NON-FACTOID QUESTIONS,"This paper proposes a neural architecture for answering non-factoid questions. The author's model improves over previous neural models for answer sentence selection. Experiments are conducted on a Japanese love advice corpus; the coolest part of the paper for me was that the model was actually rolled out to the public and its answers were rated twice as good as actual human contributors! 

It was hard for me to determine the novelty of the contribution. The authors mention that their model ""fills the gap
between answer selection and generation""; however, no generation is actually performed by the model! Instead, the model appears to be very similar to the QA-LSTM of Tan et al., 2015 except that there are additional terms in the objective to handle conclusion and supplementary sentences. The structure of the answer is fixed to a predefined template (e.g., conclusion --> supplementary), so the model is not really learning how to order the sentences. The other contribution is the ""word embedding with semantics"" portion described in sec 4.1, which is essentially just the paragraph vector model except with ""titles"" and ""categories"" instead of paragraphs. 

While the result of the paper is a model that has actually demonstrated real-life usefulness, the technical contributions do not strike me as novel enough for publication at ICLR.

Other comments:
- One major issue with the reliance of the model on the template is that you can't evaluate on commonly-used non-factoid QA datasets such as InsuranceQA. If the template were not fixed beforehand (but possibly learned by the model), you could conceivably evaluate on different datasets. 
- The examples in Table 4 don't show a clear edge in answer quality to your model; QA-LSTM seems to choose good answers as well.
- Doesn't the construction model have an advantage over the vanilla QA-LSTM in that it knows which sentences are conclusions and which are supplementary? Or does QA-LSTM also get this distinction?",,4.0,4.0
1079,False,CAN AI GENERATE LOVE ADVICE?: TOWARD NEURAL ANSWER GENERATION FOR NON-FACTOID QUESTIONS,"Summary: The paper presents an approach – Neural Answer Construction Model for the task of answering non-factoid questions, in particular, love-advice questions. The two main features of the proposed model are the following – 1) it incorporates the biases of semantics behind questions into word embeddings, 2) in addition to optimizing for closeness between questions and answers, it also optimizes for optimum combination of sentences in the predicted answer. The proposed model is evaluated using the dataset from a Japanese online QA service and is shown to outperform the baseline model (Tan et al. 2015) by 20% relatively (6% absolutely). The paper also experiments with few other baseline models (ablations of the proposed model).

Strengths:

1. The two motivations behind the proposed approach – need to understand the ambiguous use of words depending on context, and need to generate new answers rather than just selecting from answers held by QA sites – are reasonable.

2. The novelty in the paper involves the following – 1) incorporating biases of semantics behind questions into word embeddings using paragraph2vec like model, modified to take as inputs - words from questions, question title token and question category token, 2) modelling optimum combination of sentences (conclusion and supplement sentences) in the predicted answer, 3) designing abstract scenario for answers, inspired by automated web-service composition framework (Rao & Su (2005)), and 4) extracting important topics in conclusion sentence and emphasizing them in supplemental sentence using attention mechanism (attention mechanism is similar to Tan et al. 2016).

3. The proposed method is shown to outperform the current best method (Tan et al. 2015) by 20% relatively (6% absolutely) which seems to be significant improvement. 

4. The paper presents few ablations studies that provide insights on how much different components of the model (such as incorporating biases into word embeddings, incorporating attention from conclusion to supplement) are helping towards performance improvement.

Weaknesses/Suggestions/Questions:

1. How are the abstract patterns determined, i,e., how did the authors determine that the answers to love-advice questions generally constitute of sympathy, conclusion, supplement for conclusion and encouragement? How much is the improvement in performance when using abstract patterns compared to the case when not using these patters, i.e. when candidate answers are picked from union of all corpuses rather than picking from respective corpuses (corpuses for sympathy, conclusion etc.).

2. It seems that the abstract patterns are specific to the type of questions. So, the abstract patterns for love-advice will be different from those for business advice. Thus, it seems like the abstract patterns need to be hand-coded for different types and hence one model cannot generalize across different types.

3. The paper should present explicit analysis of how much combinational optimization between sentences help – comparison between model performance with and without combinational optimization keeping rest of the model architecture same. The authors could also plot the accuracy of the model as a function of the combinational optimization scores. This will provide insights into how significant are the combinational optimization scores towards overall model accuracy.


4. Paper says that current systems designed for non-factoid QA cannot generalize to questions outside those stored in QA sites and claims that this is one of the contributions of this paper. In order to ground that claim, the paper should show experimentally how well the proposed method generalized to such out-of-domain questions. Although the questions asked by human experts in the human evaluation were not from the evaluation datasets, the paper should analyze how different those questions were compared to the questions present in the evaluation datasets.

5. For human evaluation, were the outputs of the proposed model and that of the QA-LSTM model judged each judged by both the human experts OR one of the human experts judged the outputs of one system and the other human expert judged the outputs of the other system? If both the sets of outputs were each judged by both the human experts, how were the ratings of the two experts combined for every questions? 

6. I wonder why the authors did not do a human evaluation where they just ask human workers (not experts) to compare the output of the proposed model with that of the QA-LSTM model – which of the two outputs they would like to hear when asking for advice. Such an evaluation would not get biased by whether each sentence is good or not, whether the combination is good or not. Looking at the qualitative examples in Table 4, I personally like the output of the QA-LSTM more than that of the proposed model because they seem to provide a direct answer to the question (e.g., for the first example the output of the QA-LSTM says “You should wait until you feel excited”, whereas the output of the proposed model says “It is better to concentrate on how to confess your love to her” which seems a bit indirect to the question asked.)

7. Given a question, is the ground-truth answer different in the two tasks -- answer selection and answer construction?

8. The paper mentions that Attentive LSTM (Tan et al. 2016) is evaluated as the current best answer selection method (section 5.2). So, why is its accuracy lower than that of QA-LSTM in table 1. The authors explain this by pointing out the issue of questions being very long compared to answers and hence the attention being noisy. But, did these issues not exist in the dataset used by Tan et al. 2016?

9. The paper says the proposed method achieves 20% gain over current best (in Conclusion section) where they refer to QA-LSTM as the current best method. However, in the description of Attentive LSTM (section 5.2), the paper mentions that Attention LSTM is the current best method. So, could authors please clarify the discrepancy?

10. Minor correction: remove space between 20 and % in abstract.

Review Summary: The problem of non-factoid QA being dealt with in the paper is an interesting and useful problem to solve. The motivations presented in the paper behind the proposed approach are reasonable. The experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline model. However, the use of abstract patterns to determine the answer seems like hand-designing and hence it seems like these abstract patterns need to be designed for every other type of non-factoid question and hence the proposed approach is not generalizable to other types. Also, the paper needs more analysis of the results to provide insights into the contribution of different model components.",,4.0,4.0

It is assumed that the alignment can be provided as a part of training data, with Chinese Restaurant process being used in the actual experiments. 

The idea makes sense, although its applicability is limited to the domains where a monotonic alignment is available. But as discussed during the pre-review period, there has been a lot of strongly overlapping related work, such as probabilistic models with hard-alignment (Sequence Transduction With Recurrent Neural Network, Graves et al, 2012) and also attempts to use external alignments in end-to-end models (A Neural Transducer, Jaitly et al, 2015). That said, I do not think the approach is sufficiently novel. 

I also have a concern regarding the evaluation. I do not think it is fair to compare the proposed model that depends on external alignment with the vanilla soft-attention model that learns alignments from scratch. In a control experiment soft-attention could be trained to match the external alignment. Such a pretraining could reduce overfitting on the small dataset, the one on which the proposed approach brings the most improvement. On a larger dataset, especially SIGMORPHON, the improvements are not very big and are only obtained for a certain class of languages.

1087,False,Structured Sequence Modeling with Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks,"The authors address the problem of modeling temporally-changing signal on a graph, where the signal at one node changes as a function of the inputs and the hidden states of its neighborhood, the size of which is a hyperparameter. The approach follows closely that of Shi et al. 2015, but it is generalized to arbitrary graph structures rather than a fixed grid by using graph convolutions of Defferrard et al. 2016. This is not a strict generalization because the graph formulation treats all edges equally, while the conv kernels in Shi et al. have a built in directionality. The authors show results on a moving MNIST and on the Penn Tree Bank Language Modeling task.

The paper, model and experiments are decent but I have some concerns:

1. The proposed model is not exceptionally novel from a technical perspective. I usually don't mind if this is the case provided that the authors make up for the deficiency with thorough experimental evaluation, clear write up, and interesting insights into the pros/cons of the approach with respect to previous models. In this case I lean towards this not being the case.

2. The experiment results section is rather terse and light on interpretation. I'm not fully up to date on the latest of Penn Tree Bank language modeling results but I do know that it is a hotly contested and well-known dataset. I am surprised to see a comparison only to Zaremba et al 2014 where I would expect to see multiple other results.

3. The writing is not very clear and the authors don't make sufficiently strong attempt to compare the models or provide insight or comparisons into why the proposed model works better. In particular, unless I'm mistaken the word probabilities are a function of the neighborhood in the graph. What is the width of this graph? For example, suppose I sample a word in one part of the graph, doesn't this information have to propagate to the other parts of the graph along the edges? Also, it's not clear to me how the model can achieve reasonable results on moving MNIST when it cannot distinguish the direction of the moving edges. The authors state this but do not provide satisfying insight into how this can work. How does a pixel know that it should turn on in the next frame? I wish the authors thought about this more and presented it more clearly.

1088,False,Structured Sequence Modeling with Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks,"The paper proposes to combine graph convolution with RNNs to solve problems in which inputs are graphs. The two key ideas are: (i) a graph convolutional layer is used to extract features which are then fed in an RNN, and (ii) matrix multiplications are replaced by graph convolution operations. (i) is applied to language modelling, yielding lower perplexity on Penn Treebank (PTB) compared with LSTM. (ii) outperformed LSTM + CNN on the moving-MNIST.

Both two models/ideas are actually trivial and in line with the current trend of combining different architectures. For instance, the idea of replacing matrix multiplications by graph convolution is a small extension for Shi et al.

Regarding to the experiment on PTB (section 5.2), I'm skeptical about the way the experiment carried out. The reason is that, instead of using the given development set to tune the models, the authors blindly used an available configuration which is for a different model.

Pros: 
- good experimental results

Cons:
- ideas are quite trivial 
- the experiment on PTB was carried out improperly ",,4.0,4.0
1089,False,Structured Sequence Modeling with Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks,"This paper investigates the  modeling of graph sequences . Authors propose Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GRCN)  that extends convLSTM  (Shi et al. 2015) for data having an unregular graph structure at each timestep. They replace the 2D convolution with a graph convolutional operator from (Defferrad et al., 2016).
Authors propose two variations of the GRCN model. In Model 1,  the graph convolution is only applied on the input data. In Model 2, the graph convolution  is applied on both  input data and the previous hidden states. They evaluate their approaches on two different tasks, video generation using the movingMNIST dataset and world-level language modelling using Penntreebank.

On movingMNIST authors show that their GRCN 2 improves upon convLSTM. However, they evaluate only with one-layer convLSTM, while Shi et al. report better results with 3 layers (also not as good as  GRCN) . It would be nice to evaluate GCRCN in that setting as well.
While the authors show an improvement of GRCN relatively to convLSTM, GRCN on this task seems relatively weak compared to recent works such as the Video Pixel Networks (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016). It contradicts the claim that ""Model 2 has shown good performance in the case of video prediction"" in the conclusion.

For the Penntreebank experiments, author compares  their model 1 with FC-LSTM, with or without dropout. However, the results in (Zaremba et al., 2014) still seems different than the one reported here. In (Zaremba et al., 2014), they  reports a test perplexity of 78.4 for the large regularized LSTM in their table 1 which outperforms the score of the GRCN. Also, following works such as variational dropout or zoneout have since improve upon Zaremba results. Is there some differences in the experimental setting?  It would be nice to have results that are directly comparable to previous work.


Pros:
- Interesting model, 
Cons:
- Overall, the proposed contribution is relatively incremental compared to (Shi et al. 2015) and (Defferrad et al., 2016). 
- Weak results of GRCN relatively to previous works in the experiments, that do not convince of the GRCN advantages.

1090,True,Generative Multi-Adversarial Networks,"In this interesting paper the authors explore the idea of using an ensemble of multiple discriminators in generative adversarial network training. This comes with a number of benefits, mainly being able to use less powerful discriminators which may provide better training signal to the generator early on in training when strong discriminators might overpower the generator.

My main comment is about the way the paper is presented. The caption of Figure 1. and Section 3.1 suggests using the best discriminator by taking the maximum over the performance of individual ensemble members. This does not appear to be the best thing to do because we are just bound to get a training signal that is stricter than any of the individual members of the ensemble. Then the rest of the paper explores relaxing the maximum and considers various averaging techniques to obtain a ’soft-discriminator’. To me, this idea is far more appealing, and the results seem to support this, too. Skimming the paper it seems as if the authors mainly advocated always using the strongest discriminator, evidenced by my premature pre-review question earlier.

I think this work indicates the direction is promising, however I think the authors may consider to add more result vs approach which enforce discriminator gradient, such as GAN with DAE (Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching), to show advantages of multiple discriminators.",,6.0,4.0
1092,True,Generative Multi-Adversarial Networks,"The paper extends the GAN framework to accommodate multiple discriminators. The authors motivate this from two points of view:

(1) Having multiple discriminators tackle the task is equivalent to optimizing the value function using random restarts, which can potentially help optimization given the nonconvexity of the value function.

(2) Having multiple discriminators can help overcome the optimization problems arising when a discriminator is too harsh a critic. A generator receiving signal from multiple discriminators is less likely to be receiving poor gradient signal from all discriminators.

The paper's main idea looks straightforward to implement in practice and makes for a good addition to the GAN training toolbelt.

I am not very convinced by the GAM (and by extension the GMAM) evaluation metric. Without evidence that the GAN game is converging (even approximately), it is hard to make the case that the discriminators tell something meaningful about the generators with respect to the data distribution. In particular, it does not inform on mode coverage or probability mass misallocation.

The learning curves (Figure 3) look more convincing to me: they provide good evidence that increasing the number of discriminators has a stabilizing effect on the learning dynamics. However, it seems like this figure along with Figure 4 also show that the unmodified generator objective is more stable even with only one discriminator. In that case, is it even necessary to have more than one discriminator to train the generator using an unmodified objective?

Overall, I think the ideas presented in this paper show good potential, but I would like to see an extended analysis in the line of Figures 3 and 4 for more datasets before I think it is ready for publication.

1094,False,Perception Updating Networks: On architectural constraints for interpretable video generative models,"This paper presents a generative model of video sequence data where the frames are assumed to be generated by a static background with a 2d sprite composited onto it at each timestep.  The sprite itself is allowed to dynamically change its appearance and location within the image from frame to frame.  This paper follows the VAE (Variational Autoencoder) approach, where a recognition/inference network allows them to recover the latent state at each timestep.

Some results are presented on simple synthetic data (such as a moving rectangle on a black background or the “Moving MNIST” data.  However, the results are preliminary and I suspect that the assumptions used in the paper are far too strong too be useful in real videos.  On the Moving MNIST data, the numerical results are not competitive to state of the art numbers.

The model itself is also not particularly novel and the work currently misses some relevant citations.  The form of the forward model, for example, could be viewed as a variation on the DRAW paper by Gregor et al (ICML 2014).  Efficient Inference in Occlusion-Aware Generative Models of Images by Huang & Murphy (ICLR) is another relevant work, which used a variational auto-encoder with a spatial transformer and an RNN-like sequence model to model the appearance of multiple sprites on a background.

Finally, the exposition in this paper is short on many details and I don’t believe that the paper is reproducible from the text alone.

1097,True,Towards Deep Interpretability (MUS-ROVER II): Learning Hierarchical Representations of Tonal Music,"This paper proposes an interesting framework (as a follow-up work of the author's previous paper) to learn compositional rules used to compose better music. The system consists of two components, a generative component (student) and a discriminative component (teacher). The generative component is a Probabilistic Graphical Models, generating the music following learned rules. The teacher compares the generated music with the empirical distribution of exemplar music (e.g, Bach’s chorales) and propose new rules for the student to learn so that it could improve.

The framework is different from GANs that the both the generative and discriminative components are interpretable. From the paper, it seems that the system can indeed learn sensible rules from the composed music and apply them in the next iteration, if trained in a curriculum manner. However, there is no comparison between the proposed system and its previous version, nor comparison between the proposed system and other simple baselines, e.g., an LSTM generative model. This might pose a concern here. 

I found this paper a bit hard to read, partly due to (1) lots of music terms (e.g, Tbl. 1 does not make sense to me) that hinders understanding of how the system performs, and (2) over-complicated math symbols and concept. For example, In Page 4, the concept of raw/high-level feature, Feature-Induced Partition and Conceptual Hierarchy, all means a non-overlapping hierarchical clustering on the 4-dimensional feature space. Also, there seems to be no hierarchy in Informational Hierarchy, but a list of rules. It would be much clearer if the authors write the paper in a plain way.

I think the ideas and approaches are good, and certainly worth publishing and worth pursuing. I am not sure that, in the paper's current form, ICLR is an appropriate venue. (Incidentally, the issue is not the application as I think that music applications can be very appropriate, nor is the problem necessarily with the approach... see my next suggestion..). I get the sense that a long-form journal publication would actually give the authors the space necessary to fully explain these ideas, provide clearer running examples where needed, provide the necessary background for the appropriate readership, provide the necessary background on the previous system, perhaps demonstrating results on a second dataset to show generality of the approach, etc. A short conference paper just seems to me to be too dense a format for giving this project the description it merits. If it were possible to focus on just one aspect of this system, then that might work, but I do not have good suggestions for exactly how to do that. 

If the paper were revised substantially (though I cannot suggest details for how to do this within the appropriate page count), I would consider raising my score. I do think that the effort would be better invested in turning this into a long (and clearer) journal submission.

1099,True,Towards Deep Interpretability (MUS-ROVER II): Learning Hierarchical Representations of Tonal Music,"Summary: 
The paper presents an advanced self-learning model that extracts compositional rules from Bach's chorales, which extends their previous work in: 1) the rule hierarchy in both conceptual and informational dimensions; 2) adaptive 2-D memory selection which assumes the features follow Dirichlet Distribution. Sonority (column of 4 MIDI numbers) acts as word in language model: unigram statistics have been used to learn the fundamental rules in music theory, while n-grams with higher order help characterize part writing. Sonorities have been clustered together based on feature functions through iterations. The partition induced by the features is recognized as a rule if it is sufficiently significant. As a result, two sample syllabi with different difficulty strides and ""satisfactory gaps"" have been generated in terms of sets of learned rules. 

1. Quality:
 a) Strengths: In the paper, the exploration of hierarchies in two dimensions makes the learning process more cognitive and interpretable. The authors also demonstrate an effective memory selection to speed up the learning.

 b) Flaws: The paper only discussed N<=5, which might limit the learning and interpretation capacities of the proposed model, failing to capture long-distance dependence of music. (In the replies to questions, the authors mentioned they had experimented with max N=10, but I'm not sure why related results were not included in the paper). Besides the elaborated interpretation of results, a survey seeking the opinions of students in a music department might make the evaluation of system performance more persuasive.

2. Clarity:
 a) Pros: The paper clearly delivers an improved automatic theorist system which learns and represents music concepts as well as thoroughly interprets and compares the learned rules with music theory. Proper analogies and examples help the reader perceive the ideas more easily.

 b) Cons: Although detailed definitions can be found in the authors' previous MUS-ROVER I papers, it would be great if they had described the optimization more clearly (in Figure 1. and related parts).  The ""(Conceptual-Hierarchy Filter)"" row in equations (3): the prime symbol should appear in the subscript.

3. Originality:
The representation of music concepts and rules is still an open area, the paper investigate the topic in a novel way. It illustrates an alternative besides other interpretable feature learning methods such as autoencoders, GAN, etc. 

4. Significance:
It is good to see some corresponding interpretations for the learned rules from music theory. The authors mentioned students in music could and should be involved in the self-learning loop to interact, which is very interesting. I hope their advantages can be combined in the practice of music theory teaching and learning.

In this case, the family of windows in Eq(1) would therefore correspond to a significantly larger power set.

(1) It relies on the assumption that the input image is subject to a transformation on a certain Lie group (locally). Do such transformations constitute real challenges in practice? State-of-the-art CNNs, e.g. ResNet, are already quite resilient to such local deformations. What such components would add to the state of the art?

The first part has a strong emphasis on the technical part. It could benefit from some high level arguments on what the method aims to achieve, what limitation is there to overcome. I may have misunderstood the contribution (in which case please correct me) that the main novel part of the paper is the suggestion to learn the group parameterizations instead of pre-fixing them. So instead of applying it to common spatial filters as in De Brabandere et al., it is applied to Steerable Frames?

The first contribution suggests that ""general frame bases are better suited to represent sensory input data than the commonly used pixel basis."". The experiments on Cifar10+ indicate that this is not true in general. Considering the basis as a hyper-parameter, expensive search has to be conducted to find that the Gauss-Frame gives better results. I assume this does not suggest that the Gauss-Frame is always better, at least there is weak evidence on a single network presented. Maybe the first contribution has to be re-stated. Further is the ""Pixel"" network representation corrected for the larger number of parameters. As someone who is interested in using this, what are the runtime considerations? 

I would strongly suggest to improve Fig.3. The Figure uses ""w"" several times in different notations and depictions. It mixes boxes, single symbols and illustrative figures. It took some time to decipher the Figure and its flow. 


Summary: The paper is sufficiently clear, technical at many places and readability can be improved. E.g., the introduction of frames in the beginning lacks motivation and is rather unclear to someone new to this concept. The work falls in the general category of methods that impose knowledge about filter transformations into the network architecture. For me that has always two sides, the algorithmic and technical part (there are several ways to do this) and the practical side (should I do it)? This is a possible approach to this problem but after the paper I was a bit wondering what I have learned, I am certainly not inspired based on the content of the paper to integrate or build on this work. I am lacking insights into transformational parameters that are relevant for a problem. While the spatial transformer network paper was weaker on the technical elegance side, it provided exactly this: an insight into the feature transformation learned by the algorithm. I am missing this here, e.g., from Table 2  I learn that among four choices one works empirically better. What is destroyed by the x^py^p and Hermite frames that the ResNet is *not* able to recover from? You can construct network architectures that are the superset of both, so that inferior performance could be avoided. 

The algorithm is clear but it is similar to the Dynamic Filter Networks paper. And I am unfortunately not convinced about the usefulness of this particular formulation. I'd expect a stronger paper with more insights into transformations and comparisons to standard techniques, a clear delineation of when this is advised. ",,4.0,3.0
1103,False,Dynamic Steerable Frame Networks,"This works applies steerable frames for various tasks where convolutional neural networks with location invariant operators are traditionally applied. Authors provide a detailed overview of steerable frames followed with an experimental section which applies dynamic steerable network to small machine learning problems where the steerability is conceptually useful.

Even though the evaluation is performed only on few small tasks, the reason why more tasks were not evaluated is that piece-wise pose invariance is needed only for a subset of tasks. The fact, that simply using overcomplete bases as a sort of ""feature pre-processing"" improves the results for already highly optimized ResNet and DenseNet architectures is quite interesting achievement.

For the edge detection, a relatively hard baseline is selected - the Dynamic Filter Networks, which already attempts to achieve position invariant filters. The fact that DSFN improves the performance on this task verifies that regressing the parametrization of the steerable filters yields better results than regressing the filters directly.

In the last experiment authors apply the network to video classification using LSTMs and they show that the improved performance is not due to increased capacity of the network.

In general, it is quite interesting work. Even though it does not offer ground-breaking results (mainly in a sense of not performing experiments on larger tasks), it is theoretically interesting and shows promising results.

There are few minor issues and suggestions related to the paper:
* For the LSTM experiment, in order to be more exact, it would be useful to include information about total number of parameters, as the network which estimates the pose also increases the number of parameters.
* Would it be possible to provide more details about how the back-propagation is done through the steerable filters?
* For the Edge Detection experiment, it would be useful to provide results for some standard baseline - e.g. CNN with a similar number of parameters. Simply to see how useful it is to have location-variant filters for this task.
* The last sentence in second paragraph on page 1 is missing a verb. Also it is maybe unnecessary.
* The hyphenation for ConvNet is incorrect on multiple places (probably `\hyphenation{Conv-Net}` would fix it).

1104,True,Deep Probabilistic Programming,"Thank you for an interesting read.

I found this paper very interesting. Since I don't think (deterministic) approximate inference is separated from the modelling procedure (cf. exact inference), it is important to allow the users to select the inference method to suit their needs and constraints. I'm not an expert of PPL, but to my knowledge this is the first package that I've seen which put more focus on compositional inference. Leveraging tensorflow is also a plus, which allows flexible computation graph design as well as parallel computation using GPUs.

The only question I have is about the design of flexible objective functions to learn hyper-parameters (or in the paper those variables associated with delta q distributions). It seems hyper-parameter learning is also specified as inference, which makes sense if using MAP. However the authors also demonstrated other objective functions such as Renyi divergences, does that mean the user need to define a new class of inference method whenever they want to test an alternative loss function?",,7.0,4.0
1105,True,Deep Probabilistic Programming,"The authors propose a new software package for probabilistic programming, taking advantage of recent successful tools used in the deep learning community. The software looks very promising and has the potential to transform the way we work in the probabilistic modelling community, allowing us to perform rapid-prototyping to iterate through ideas quickly. The composability principles are used insightfully, and the extension of inference to HMC for example, going beyond VI inference (which is simple to implement using existing deep learning tools), makes the software even more compelling. 

However, the most important factor of any PPL is whether it is practical for real-world use cases. This was not demonstrated sufficiently in the submission. There are many example code snippets given in the paper, but most are not evaluated. The Dirichlet process mixture model example (Figure 12) is an important one: do the proposed black-box inference tools really work for this snippet? and will the GAN example (Figure 7) converge when optimised with real data? To convince the community of the practicality of the package it will be necessary to demonstrate these empirically. Currently the only evaluated model is a VAE with various inference techniques, which are not difficult to implement using pure TF.

Presentation:
* Paper presentation could be improved. For example the authors could use more signalling for what is about to be explained. On page 5 qbeta and qz are used without explanation - the authors could mention that an example will be given thereafter.
* I would also suggest to the authors to explain in the preface how the layers are implemented, and how the KL is handled in VI for example.
It will be useful to discuss what values are optimised and what values change as inference is performed (even before section 4.4). This was not clear for the majority of the paper. 

Experiments:
* Why is the run time not reported in table 1?
* What are the ""difficulties around convergence"" encountered with the analytical entropies? inference issues become more difficult to diagnose as inference is automated. Are there tools to diagnose these with the provided toolbox? 
* Did HMC give sensible results in the experiment at the bottom of page 8? only run time is reported. 
* How difficult is it to get the inference to work (eg HMC) when we don't have full control over the computational graph structure and sampler?
* It would be extremely insightful to give a table comparing the performance (run time, predictive log likelihood, etc) of the various inference tools on more models.
* What benchmarks do you intend to use in the Model Zoo? the difficulty with probabilistic modelling is that there are no set benchmarks over which we can evaluate and compare many models. Model zoo is sensible for the Caffe ecosystem because there exist few benchmarks a large portion of the community was working on (ImageNet for example). What datasets would you use to compare the DPMM on for example?

Minor comments:
* Table 1: I would suggest to compare to Li & Turner with alpha=0.5 (the equivalent of Hellinger distance) as they concluded this value performs best. I'm not sure why alpha=-1 was chosen here. 
* How do you handle discrete distributions (eg Figure 5)?
* x_real is not defined in Figure 7.
* I would suggest highlighting M in Figure 8.
* Comma instead of period after ""rized), In"" on page 8.

In conclusion I would say that the software developments presented here are quite exciting, and I'm glad the authors are pushing towards practical and accessible ""inference for all"". In its current form though I am forced to give the submission itself a score of 5.",,5.0,4.0

modern probabilistic inference methods in an easily usable form.
The paper provides a brief review of the most important techniques
especially from a representation learning perspective, combined with
two experiments on implementing various modern variational inference
methods and GPU-accelerated HMC.

The first experiment (variational inference) would be more valuable if
there was a clear link to complete code to reproduce the results
provided. The HMC experiment looks OK, except the characterising Stan
as a hand-optimised implementation seems unfair as the code is clearly
not hand-optimised for this specific model and hardware configuration.
I do not think anyone doubts the quality of your implementation, so
please do not ruin the picture by unsubstantiated sensationalist
claims. Instead of current drama, I would suggest comparing
head-to-head against Stan on single core and separately reporting the
extra speedups you gain from parallelisation and GPU. These numbers
would also help the readers to estimate the performance of the method
for other hardware configurations.


Clarity:

The paper is in general clearly written and easy to read. The numerous
code examples are helpful, but also difficult as it is sometimes

notebook would be great, but even text or HTML would be easier to
copy-paste from than a pdf like the paper) with complete runnable code
for all the examples.


Originality:

    - Mainly an architecture engineering/application paper(bringing together various well-known techniques), not much novelty.
    - The proposed model is potentially slower than the regular models since it needs to operate over the characters instead of the words and uses several RNNs.

1108,False,Deep Character-Level Neural Machine Translation By Learning Morphology,"Update after reading the authors' responses & the paper revision dated Dec 21:
I have removed the comment ""insufficient comparison to past work"" in the title & update the score from 3 -> 5.
The main reason for the score is on novelty. The proposal of HGRU & the use of the R matrix are basically just to achieve the effect of ""whether to continue from character-level states or using word-level states"". It seems that these solutions are specific to symbolic frameworks like Theano (which the authors used) and TensorFlow. This, however, is not a problem for languages like Matlab (which Luong & Manning used) or Torch.

-----

This is a well-written paper with good analysis in which I especially like Figure 5. However I think there is little novelty in this work. The title is about learning morphology but there is nothing specifically enforced in the model to learn morphemes or subword units. For example, maybe some constraints can be put on the weights in w_i in Figure 1 to detect morpheme boundaries or some additional objective like MDL can be used (though it's not clear how these constraints can be incorporated cleanly). 

Moreover, I'm very surprised that litte comparison (only a brief mention) was given to the work of (Luong & Manning, 2016) [1], which trains deep 8-layer word-character models and achieves much better results on English-Czech, e.g., 19.6 BLEU compared to 17.0 BLEU achieved in the paper. I think the HGRU thing is over-complicated in terms of presentation. If I read correctly, what HGRU does is basically either continue the character decoder or reset using word-level states at boundaries, which is what was done in [1]. Luong & Manning (2016) even make it more efficient by not having to decode all target words at the morpheme level & it would be good to know the speed of the model proposed in this ICLR submission. What end up new in this paper are perhaps different analyses on what a character-based model learns & adding an additional RNN layer in the encoder.

1109,True,Lie-Access Neural Turing Machines,"*** Paper Summary ***

This paper formalizes the properties required for addressing (indexing) memory augmented neural networks as well as how to pair the addressing with read/write operation. It then proposes a framework in which any Lie group as the addressing space. Experiments on algorithmic tasks are reported.

*** Review Summary ***

This paper brings unity and formalism in the requirement for memory addressing while maintaining differentiable memories. Its proposal provide a generic scheme to build addressing mechanisms. When comparing the proposed approach with key-value networks, the unbounded number of memory cells and the lack of incentive to reuse indexes might reveal impractical. 

*** Detailed Review ***

The paper reads well, has appropriate relevance to related work. The unified presentation of memory augmented networks is clear and brings unity to the field. The proposed approach is introduced clearly, is powerful and gives a tool that can be reused after reading the article. I do not appreciate that the growing memory is not mentioned as a drawback. It should be stressed and a discussion on the impact it has on efficiency/scalability is needed.",,8.0,4.0

This allows to place memory elements as points on a manifold, while still allowing training with backpropagation.

- novel and interesting idea for memory access
- nicely written

1111,True,Lie-Access Neural Turing Machines,"The Neural Turing Machine and related “external memory models” have demonstrated an ability to learn algorithmic solutions by utilizing differentiable analogues of conventional memory structures. In particular, the NTM, DNC and other approaches provide mechanisms for shifting a memory access head to linked memories from the current read position.

The NTM, which is the most relevant to this work, uses a differentiable version of a Turing machine tape. The controller outputs a kernel which “softly” shifts the head, allowing the machine to read and write sequences. Since this soft shift typically “smears” the focus of the head, the controller also outputs a sharpening parameter which compensates by refocusing the distribution.

The premise of this work is to notice that while the NTM emulates a differentiable version of a Turing tape, there is no particular reason that one is constrained to follow the topology of a Turing tape. Instead they propose memory stored at a set of points on a manifold and shift actions which form a Lie group. In this way, memory points can have have different relationships to one another, rather than being constrained to Z.

This is mathematically elegant and here they empirically test models with the shift group R^2 acting on R^2 and the rotation group acting on a sphere.

Overall, the paper is well communicated and a novel idea.

The primary limitation of this paper is its limited impact. While this approach is certainly mathematically elegant, even likely beneficial for some specific problems where the problem structure matches the group structure, it is not clear that this significantly contributes to building models capable of more general program learning. Instead, it is likely to make an already complex and slow model such as the NTM even slower. In general, it would seem memory topology is problem specific and should therefore be learned rather than specified.

The baseline used for comparison is a very simple model, which does not even having the sharpening (the NTM approach to solving the problem of head distributions becoming ‘smeared’). There is also no comparison with the successor to the NTM, the DNC, which provides a more general approach to linking memories based on prior memory accesses.

Minor issues:
Footnote on page 3 is misleading regarding the DNC. While the linkage matrix explicitly excludes the identity, the controller can keep the head in the same position by gating the following of the link matrix.
Figures on page 8 are difficult to follow.

1113,False,Extrapolation and learning equations,"Thank you for an interesting read. 

To my knowledge, very few papers have looked at transfer learning with **no** target domain data (the authors called this task as ""extrapolation""). This paper clearly shows that the knowledge of the underlying system dynamics is crucial in this case. The experiments clearly showed the promising potential of the proposed EQL model. I think EQL is very interesting also from the perspective of interpretability, which is crucial for data analysis in scientific domains.

Quesions and comments:

1. Multiplication units. By the universal approximation theorem, multiplication can also be represented by a neural network in the usual sense. I agree with the authors' explanation of interpolation and extrapolation, but I still don't quite understand why multiplication unit is crucial here. I guess is it because this representation generalises better when training data is not that representative for the future?

2. Fitting an EQL vs. fitting a polynomial. It seems to me that the number of layers in EQL has some connections to the degree of the polynomial. Assume we know the underlying dynamics we want to learn can be represented by a polynomial. Then what's the difference between fitting a polynomial (with model selection techniques to determine the degree) and fitting an EQL (with model selection techniques to determine the number of layers)? Also your experiments showed that the selection of basis functions (specific to the underlying dynamics you want to learn) is crucial for the performance. This means you need to have some prior knowledge on the form of the equation anyway!

3. Ben-David et al. 2010 has presented some error bounds for the hypothesis that is trained on source data but tested on the target data. I wonder if your EQL model can achieve better error bounds?

There should be some restrictions on 'a' and 'b' as well as the approximate equality doesn't hold for all real values of 'a' and 'b'. Although, for a=2*pi and b=pi/4, the claim is correct so the model is predicting a correct solution within certain limits.      
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
- Most of the experiments involve up to 4 variables. It would be interesting to see how the neural approach models hundreds of variables.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
- Another way of looking at the model is that the non-linearities like sine, cosine, multiplication act as basis functions. If the data is a linear combination of such functions, the model will be able to learn the weights. As division is not one of the non-linearities, predicting expressions in Equation 13 seems unlikely. Hence, I was wondering, is it possible to make sure that this architecture is a universal approximator.

In this sense it is similar in spirit to scheduled sampling (Bengio et al) and SEARN (Daume et al) DAgger (Ross et al) which consider a ""roll-in"" mixture of the target and model distributions during training. It was clarified in the pre-review questions that these targets are generated on-line rather than from a lagged distribution, which I think makes the algorithm pseudocode somewhat misleading if I understand it correctly.

This is an incremental improvement on the idea of label softening/smoothing that has recently been revived, and so the novelty is not that high. The author points out that co-label similarity is better preserved by this method but it doesn't follow that this is causal re: regularization; a natural baseline would be a fixed, soft label distribution, as well as one where the softening/temperature of the label distribution is gradually reduced (as one would expect for this method to do as the model gets closer and closer to reproducing the target distribution).

It's an interesting and somewhat appealing idea but the case is not clearly made that this is all that useful. The dropout baselines for MNIST seem quite far from results already in the literature (Srivastava et al 2014 achieves 1.06% with a 3x1024 MLP with dropout and a simple max norm constraint; the dropout baselines here fail to break 1.3% which is rather high by contemporary standards on the permutation-invariant task), and results for CIFAR10 are quite far from the current state of the art, making it difficult to judge the contribution in light of other innovations. The largest benchmark considered is SVHN where the reported accuracies are quite bad indeed; SOTA for single net performance has been less than half the reported error rates for 3-4 years now. It's unclear what conclusions can be drawn about how this would help (or even hurt) in a better-tuned setting.

I have remaining reservations about data hygiene, namely reporting minimum test loss/maximum test accuracy rather than an unbiased method for model selection (minimum validation set error, for example). Relatedly, the regularization potential of early stopping on a validation set is not considered. See, e.g. the protocol in Goodfellow et al (2013).",,4.0,5.0

They claim that this prevents the disappearing of co-label similarity after early training and  yields a competitive regularization to dropout without sacrificing network capacity.

In order to make a fair comparison to dropout,  the dropout should be tuned carefully. Showing that it performs better than dropout regularization for some particular values of dropout (Table 2) does not demonstrate a convincing advantage. It is possible that dropout performs better after a reasonable tuning with cross-validation.

The baseline architectures used in the experiments do not belong the recent state of art methods thus yielding significantly lower accuracy. It seems also that experiment setup does not involve any data augmentation, the results can also change with augmentation. It is not clear why number of epochs are set to a small number like 100 without putting some convergence tests.. Therefore the significance of the method is not convincingly demonstrated in empirical study.

Co-label similarities could be calculated using softmax results at final layer rather than using predicted labels.  The advantage over dropout is not clear in Figure 4, the dropout is set to 0.2 without any cross-validation.  


Regularizing by enforcing the training steps to keep co-label similarities is interesting idea but not very novel and the results are not significant.

-  Can you explain better the reason for using the particular updates in (3) and (4) better? Why don't you do for example totally corrective update, e.g. take convex combination of all \cal{F}'s (or some portion) up to current iteration in (3)? Therefore \beta and \gamma should be tuned reasonably well to see whether (3) and (4) is really helping or not and the range for cross validation should be reported.

- The reason to set n_t n_b is not satisfactory.  It is crucial to cross-validate such parameters. Isn't  n_t = {1,2} unreasonably small number that can cause unstable results? why all n_b and n_t are equal?Are there results on other n_b and n_t's that were tried?

- It is stated that colabel similarities disappear when network starts to overfit. However distillation ( Hinton et.al. ,2015 ) captures colabel similarities after training a model and using distillation. This method seems an iterative extension of distillation without using a bigger teacher model. Does proposed method gives better results then a two step version of distillation ?  

- How do you tune \lambda for weight decay? 

- From paper: ""We considered a frozen set of hyper-parameters for the SoftTarget regularization to show that SoftTarget regularization can still work without a having to conduct a large grid search"". This argument is not valid in ML, maybe if you did a reasonable search, you would get worse results (since you should not look test error until you finish the cross-validation).   Why a common hyper parameter tuning procedure is not used e.g. random search (Bergstra and Bengio, JMLR 2012) or Bayesian optimization (Snoek et al ,NIPS 2012) ?

3. regressing a space-time function to satisfy the latter solutions at the sampled points (and hopefully generalize beyond those points).

I actually find the proposed algorithm interesting, and potentially useful in practice. The classic grid-based simulation of PDEs is often too expensive to be practical, due to the curse of dimensionality. Hence, learning the solution of PDEs makes a lot of sense for practical settings. On the other hand, as the authors point out, simply running gradient descent on the regression loss function does not work, because of the non-differentiablity of the ""min"" that shows up in the studied PDEs.

Therefore, I think the proposed idea is actually very interesting approach to learning the PDE solution in presence of non-differentability, which is indeed a ""challenging"" setup for numerically solving PDEs.

1123,True,Deep Variational Information Bottleneck,"Thank you for an interesting read. I personally like the information bottleneck principle and am very happy to see its application to deep neural networks. To my knowledge, this is the first paper that applies IB to train deep networks (the original papers only presented the concept), but see below for the note of independent work claim. 

The derivation of the variational lowerbound is very clear, even for those who are not very familiar with variational inference. Also the explanation of the IB principle is clear. Experimental results seem to be very promising.

I found the presentation for the model a bit confusing. In variational inference/information maximisation, p usually denotes the model and q represents the ""inference engine"". This means the choice of inference method is independent to the modelling procedure. However the presented VIB assumed p(x, y) as the **underlying data distribution** (and approximated by the empirical distribution), thus here the model is actually q(y|z)p(z|x). Then the authors presented p(y|x) as the **predictive distribution** in page 8, paragraph 2 of section 4.2.3. Predictive in what sense? I guess you meant p(y|x) = \int q(y|z) p(z|x) dz in this case, but this makes the two definitions contradict to each other!

The authors have made an interesting connection to variational auto-encoder and the warm-up training (by tuning beta). However, even when the loss function formula is the same to the variational lowerbound used in VAE (in this case beta = 1), the underlying model is different! For example, r(z) in VIB is the variational approximation to p(z) (which means r(z) is not a component in the model), while in VAE it is the prior distribution which is actually defined in the modelling procedure. Similaly p(z|x) in VIB is included in the model, while in VAE that is the approximate posterior and can be independently chosen (e.g. you can use p(x|z) as a deep NN but p(z|x) as a deep NN or a Gaussian process).

In summary, I think the presentation for the modelling procedure is unclear. I hope these point would be made clearer in revision since the current presentation makes me uncomfortable as a Bayesian person. In the VAE part, it's better to clearly mention the difference between VIB and VAE, and provide some intuitions if the VIB interpretation is preferred.

**claim for independent work**
The authors claimed that the manuscript presented an independent work to Chalk et al. 2016 which is online since May 2016. It seems to me that nowadays deep learning research is very competitve that many people publish the same idea at the same time. So I would trust this claim and commend the authors' honesty, but in case this is not true, I would not recommend the manuscript for acceptance.",,6.0,3.0
1124,True,Deep Variational Information Bottleneck,"Update: raised the score, because I think the arguments about adversarial examples are compelling.  I think that the paper convincingly proves that this method acts as a decent regularizer, but I'm not convinced that it's a competitive regularizer.  For example, I don't believe that there is sufficient evidence that it gives a better regularizer than dropout/normalization/etc.  I also think that it will be much harder to tune than these other methods (discussed in my rebuttal reply).  

----

Summary: If I understand correctly, this paper proposes to take the ""bottleneck"" term from variational autoencoders which pulls the latent variable towards a noise prior (like N(0,1)) and apply it in a supervised learning context where the reconstruction term log(p(x|z)) is replaced with the usual supervised cross-entropy objective.  

The argument is that this is an effective regularizer and increases robustness to adversarial attacks.  

Pros: 

-The presentation is quite good and the paper is easy to follow.  

-The idea is reasonable and the relationship to previous work is well described.  

-The robustness to adversarial examples experiment seems convincing, though I'm not an expert in this area.  Is there any way to compare to an external quantitative baseline on robustness to adversarial examples?  This would help a lot, since I'm not sure how the method here compares with other regularizers in terms of combatting adversarial examples.  For example, if one uses a very high dropout rate, does this confer a comparable robustness to adversarial examples (perhaps at the expense of accuracy)?  

Cons: 

-MNIST accuracy results don't seem very strong, unless I'm missing something.  The Maxout paper from ICML 2013 listed many permutation invariant MNIST results with error rates below 1%.  So the 1.13% error rate listed here doesn't necessarily prove that the method is a competitive regularizer.  I also suspect that tuning this method to make it work well is harder than other regularizers like dropout.  

-There are many distinct architectural choices with this method, particularly in how many hidden layers come before and after z.  For example, the output could directly follow z, or there could be several layers between z and the output.  As far as I can tell the paper says that p(y | z) is a simple logistic regression (i.e. one weight matrix followed by softmax), but it's not obvious why this choice was made.  Did it work best empirically?  

Other: 

-I wonder what would happen if you ""trained against"" the discovered adversarial examples while also using the method from this paper.  Would it learn to have a higher variance p(z | x) when presented with an adversarial example?  ",,7.0,4.0
1125,True,Deep Variational Information Bottleneck,"Summary:
The paper “Deep Variational Information Bottleneck” explores the optimization of neural networks for variational approximations of the information bottleneck (IB; Tishby et al., 1999). On the example of MNIST, the authors show that this may be used for regularization or to improve robustness against adversarial attacks.

Review:
The IB is potentially very useful for important applications (regularization, adversarial robustness, and privacy are mentioned in the paper). Combining the IB with recent advances in deep learning to make it more widely applicable is an excellent idea. But given that the theoretical contribution is a fairly straight-forward application of well-known ideas, I would have liked to see a stronger experimental section.

Since the proposed approach allows us to scale IB, a better demonstration of this would have been on a larger problem than MNIST. It is also not clear whether the proposed approach will still work well to regularize more interesting networks with many layers.

Why is dropout not included in the quantitative comparison of robustness to adversarial examples (Figure 4)?

How was the number of samples (12) chosen?

What are the error bars in Figure 1 (a)?

On page 7 the authors claim “the posterior covariance becomes larger” as beta “decreases” (increases?). Is this really the case? It’s hard to judge based on Figure 1, since the figures are differently scaled.

It might be worth comparing to variational fair autoencoders (Louizos et al., 2016), which also try to learn representations minimizing the information shared with an aspect of the input.

1127,False,Automated Generation of Multilingual Clusters for the Evaluation of Distributed Representations,"First, let me praise the authors for generating and releasing an NLP data set: a socially useful task.

The authors use an algorithm to generate a 500-cluster-per-language data set in semantic similarity. This brings up a few points.

1. If the point of using the algorithm is to be scalable, why release such a small data set? It's roughly the same order of magnitude as the data sets released in the SemEval tasks over the recent years. I would have expected something orders of magnitude larger.

2. The authors hand checked a small subset of the clusters: they found one where it was ambiguous, and should probably have been removed. Mechanical Turk can scale pretty well -- why not post-facto filter all of the clusters using MT? This is (in effect) how ImageNet was created, and it has millions of items.

3. Evaluating data set papers is an tricky issue. What makes a data set ""good"" or publishable? There are a number of medium-sized NLP data sets released every year (e.g., through SemEval). Those are designed to address tasks in NLP that people find interesting. I don't know of a data set that exactly addresses the task that the authors propose: the task is trying to address the idea of semantic similarity, which has had multiple data sets thrown at it since SemEval 2012. I wish that the paper had included comparisons to show that the particular task / data combination is better suited for analyzing semantic similarity than other existing data sets.

Two final notes:

A. This paper doesn't seem very well-suited to ICLR.  New NLP data sets may be indirectly useful for evaluating word embeddings (and hence representations). But, I didn't learn much from the paper: GloVe is empirically less good for semantic similarity than other embeddings? If true, why? That would be interesting.

1128,False,Automated Generation of Multilingual Clusters for the Evaluation of Distributed Representations,"This paper introduces a new dataset to evaluate word representations. The task considered in the paper, called outlier detection (also known as word intrusion), is to identify which word does not belong to a set of semantically related words. The task was proposed by Camacho-Collados & Navigli (2016) as an evaluation of word representations. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new dataset for this task, covering 5 languages. The dataset was generated automatically from the Wikidata hierarchy.
Entities which are instances of the same category are considered as belonging to the same cluster, and outliers are sampled at various distances in the tree. Several heuristics are then proposed to exclude uninteresting clusters from the dataset.

Developing good ressources to evaluate word representations is an important task. The new dataset introduced in this paper might be an interesting addition to the existing ones (however, it is hard to say by only reviewing the paper). I am a bit concerned by the lack of discussion and comparison with existing approaches (besides word similarity datasets). In particular, I believe it would be interesting to discuss the advantages of this evaluation/dataset, compared to existing ones such as word analogies. The proposed evaluation also seems highly related to entity typing, which is not discussed in the paper.

Overall, I believe that introducing ressources for evaluating word representations is very important for the community. However, I am a bit ambivalent about this submission.

Should we design models that can also model the entity reference at the same time? What are the roles of the linguistic features here?

These reading comprehension datasets such as CNN/Daily Mail are on the simpler side because they do not generally involve chains of reasoning over multiple pieces of supporting evidence as can be found in datasets like MCTest. Many models have been proposed for this task, and the paper breaks down these models into ""aggregation readers"" and ""explicit reference readers."" The authors show that the aggregation readers organize their hidden states into a predicate structure which allows them to mimic the explicit reference readers. The authors then experiment with adding linguistic features, including reference features, to the existing models to improve performance.

I appreciate the re-naming and re-writing of the paper to make it more clear that the aggregation readers are specifically learning a predicate structure, as well as the inclusion of results about dimensionality of the symbol space. Further, I think the effort to organize and categorize several different reading comprehension models into broader classes is useful, as the field has been producing many such models and the landscape is unclear. 

The concerns with this paper are that the predicate structure demonstrated is fairly simple, and it is not clear that it provides insight towards the development of better models in the future, since the ""explicit reference readers"" need not learn it, and the CNN/Daily Mail dataset has very little headroom left as demonstrated by Chen et al. 2016. The desire for ""dramatic improvements in performance"" mentioned in the discussion section probably cannot be achieved on these datasets. More complex datasets would probably involve multi-hop inference which this paper does not discuss. Further, the message of the paper is a bit scattered and hard to parse, and could benefit from a bit more focus.

Second, I wish the discussion on predication sheds more practical insights into dataset design or model design to better tackle reading comprehension challenges. In that sense, it may have been more helpful if the authors could make more precise analysis on different types of reading comprehension challenges, what types of logical structure are lacking in various existing models and datasets, and point to specific directions where the community needs to focus more.

Note that such external constraints do not seem to arise from the information-theoretic formalism as articulated by the authors. This casts doubt regarding the validity or completeness of the proposed formal motivation as currently exposed.  What the extra regularization does from an information-theoretic perspective remains unclearly articulated (e.g. interpretation of lambda strength?).

On the experimental front, empirical support for the approach is very weak: few experiments on synthetic and small scale data. The modified DAE's test errors on MNIST are larger than those of Original DAE all the time expect for one precise setting of lambda, and then the original DAE performance is still within the displayed error-bar of the modified DAE.

The issue of continuous variables can be ameliorated by discretizing as in pixel CNN for example. As another bonus, these architectures are very stable and can be trained with much much bigger models.

1) The proposed amortized MAP inference is novel and different from the previous SR methods. Combined with GAN, this framework can obtain plausible and good results. Compared with another GAN-based SR methods - Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network, question may arise as to what this new formulation adds to the latest state-of-the-art.

2) Using an affine projection architecture as a constraint, the model do not need any corresponding {HR, LR} image pairs for training. However, when training the affine projection layer, we still need the {HR, LR} image pairs. Does it mean that we merely transfer this training procedure to the training of affine projection?

3) The paper presents many results of the framework, including the results of natural images from ImageNet. Can the author also provide the results of Set5, Set14 or BSD100, which are conventional test dataset for SR, so that we can perform a fair comparison with previous work.

4) I see that the size of the results of nature images presented in this paper are limited to 128*128. Can this framework perform well on images with larger size? Because SR will encounter input with arbitrary size.

The interior gradient is the gradient measured on a scaled version of the input.  The integrated gradient is the integral of interior gradients over all scaling factors.  Visualizations comparing integrated gradients with standard gradients on real images input to the Inception CNN show that integrated gradients correspond to an intuitive notion of feature importance.

Only the baseline (simply the standard gradient) is presented as reference for qualitative comparison.  Yet, the paper cites numerous other works (DeepLift, layer-wise relevance propagation, guided backpropagation) that all attack the same problem of feature importance.

1145,False,Gradients of Counterfactuals,"The authors propose to measure “feature importance”, or specifically, which pixels contribute most to a network’s classification of an image. A simple (albeit not particularly effective) heuristic for measuring feature importance is to measure the gradients of the predicted class wrt each pixel in an input image I. This assigns a score to each pixel in I (that ranks how much the output prediction would change if a given pixel were to change). In this paper, the authors build on this and propose to measure feature importance by computing gradients of the output wrt scaled version of the input image, alpha*I, where alpha is a scalar between 0 and 1, then summing across all values of alpha to obtain their feature importance score. Here the scaling is simply linear scaling of the pixel values (alpha=0 is all black image, alpha=1 is original image). The authors call these scaled images “counterfactuals” which seems like quite an unnecessarily grandiose name for literally, a scaled image. 

The authors show a number of visualizations that indicate that the proposed feature importance score is more reasonable than just looking at gradients only with respect to the original image. They also show some quantitative evidence that the pixels highlighted by the proposed measure are more likely to fall on the objects rather than spurious parts of the image (in particular, see figure 5). The method is also applied to other types of networks. The quantitative evidence is quite limited and most of the paper is spent on qualitative results.

While the goal of understanding deep networks is of key importance, it is not clear whether this paper really help elucidate much. The main interesting observation in this paper is that scaling an image by a small alpha (i.e. creating a faint image) places more “importance” on pixels on the object related to the correct class prediction. Beyond that, the paper builds a bit on this, but no deeper insight is gained. The authors propose some hand-wavy explanation of why using small alpha (faint image) may force the network to focus on the object, but the argument is not convincing. It would have been interesting to try to probe a bit deeper here, but that may not be easy.

Ultimately, it is not clear how the proposed scheme for feature importance ranking is useful. First, it is still quite noisy and does not truly help understand what a deep net is doing on a particular image. Performing a single gradient descent step on an image (or on the collection of scaled versions of the image) hardly begins to probe the internal workings of a network. Moreover, as the authors admit, the scheme makes the assumption that each pixel is independent, which is clearly false.

Considering the paper presents a very simple idea, it is far too long. The main paper is 14 pages, up to 19 with references and appendix. In general the writing is long-winded and overly verbose. It detracted substantially from the paper. The authors also define unnecessary terminology. “Gradients of Coutnerfactuals” sounds quite fancy, but is not very related to the ideas explored in the writing.

1146,False,Gated-Attention Readers for Text Comprehension,"SUMMARY.

The paper proposes a machine reading approach for cloze-style question answering.
The proposed system first encodes the query and the document using a bidirectional gru. These two representations are combined together using a Gated Attention (GA).
GA calculates the compatibility of each word in the document and the query as a probability distribution.
For each word in the document a gate is calculated weighting the query representation according to the word compatibility.
Ultimately, the gate is applied to the gru-encoded document word.
The resulting word vectors are re-encoded with a bidirectional GRU.
This process is performed for multiple hops. After k hops, the probability of a word to be part of the answer is calculated by a log-linear model that take as input the last word representations, and the concatenation of the last query representation before and after the cloze token.

OVERALL JUDGMENT
The main contribution of the paper is the gated attention mechanism, that in my opinion, is a simple and interesting idea.
The paper is well thought, and the ablation study on the benefits given by the gated attention are convincing.
The GA reader as whole model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on 3 benchmarks and seems very promising also on the CBT dataset.
I would have liked to see some discussion on why the model works less well on the CBT dataset, though.

1147,False,Gated-Attention Readers for Text Comprehension,"Summary:

The authors propose a multi-hop ""gated attention"" model, which models the interactions between query and document representations, for answering cloze-style questions. The document representation is attended to sequentially over multiple-hops using similarity with the query representation (using a dot-product) as the scoring/attention function. 
The proposed method improves upon (CNN, Daily Mail, Who-Did-What datasets) or is comparable to (CBT dataset) the state-of-the-art results.


Pros:

1. Nice idea on heirarchical attention for modulating the context (document) representation by the task-specific (query) representation.
2. The presentation is clear with thorough experimental comparison with the latest results.


Comments:

1. The overall system presents a number of architectural elements: (1) attention at multiple layers (multi-hop), (2) query based attention for the context (or gated attention), (3) encoding the query vector at each layer independently.
It is important to breakdown the gain in performance due to the above factors: the ablation study presented in section 4.4 helps establish the importance of Gated Attention (#2 above). However, it is not clear:

  (1) how much multiple-hops of gated-attention contribute to the performance.
  (2) how important is it to have a specialized query encoder for each layer.

Understanding the above better, will help simplify the architecture.


2. The tokens are represented using L(w) and C(w). It is not clear if C(w) is crucial for the performance of the proposed method.
There is a significant performance drop when C(w) is absent (e.g. in ""GA Reader--""; although there are other changes in ""GA Reader--"" which could affect the performance). Hence, it is not clear how much does the main idea, i.e., gated attention contributes towards the superior performance of the proposed method.

1148,False,Gated-Attention Readers for Text Comprehension,"This paper presents an interesting idea for iteratively re-weighting the word representations in a document (hence the GRU-coded doc representation as well) with a simple multiplication operation. As the authors correctly pointed out, such an operation serves as a ""filter"" to reduce the attentions to less relevant parts in the document, hence leading to better performance of the modeling.

The results are or close to the state-of-the-art for a few Cloze-style QA tasks. This paper would deserve an even higher score, if the following limitations could be addressed better:

1. While interesting and conceptually simple (though with significant increased computational overheads), the architecture proposed in the paper is for a very specific task. 

2. The improvement of the main idea of this paper (gated attention) is less significant, comparing GA Reader-- vs. GA Reader, while the latter includes a number of engineering tricks such as adding character embedding and using a word embedding trained from larger corpus (GloVe), as well as some small improvements on the modeling by using token-specific attention in (5).

1151,True,Adversarial Machine Learning at Scale,"This paper is a well written paper. This paper can be divided into 2 parts:
1.Adversary training on ImageNet 
2.Empirical study of label leak, single/multiple step attack, transferability and importance of model capacity

For part [1], I don’t think training without clean example will not make reasonable ImageNet level model. Ian’s experiment in “Explaining and Harnessing Adversarial Examples” didn't use BatchNorm, which may be important for training large scale model. This part looks like an extension to Ian’s work with Inception-V3 model. I suggest to add an experiment of training without clean samples.

For part [2], The experiments cover most variables in adversary training, yet lack technical depth.  The depth, model capacity experiments can be explained by regularizer effect of adv training;  Label leaking is novel; In transferability experiment with FGSM, if we do careful observe on some special MNIST FGSM example, we can find augmentation effect on numbers, which makes grey part on image to make the number look more like the other numbers. Although this effect is hard to be observed with complex data such as CIFAR-10 or ImageNet, they may be related to the authors' observation ""FGSM examples are most transferable"".  

In this part the authors raise many interesting problems or guess, but lack theoretical explanations. 

Overall I think these empirical observations are useful for future work.",,6.0,4.0
1152,True,Adversarial Machine Learning at Scale,"This paper has two main contributions: 
(1) Applying adversarial training to imagenet, a larger dataset than previously considered 
(2) Comparing different adversarial training approaches, focusing importantly on the transferability of different methods. The authors also uncover and explain the label leaking effect which is an important contribution.

This paper is clear, well written and does a good job of assessing and comparing adversarial training methods and understanding their relation to one another. A wide range of empirical results are shown which helps elucidate the adversarial training procedure. This paper makes an important contribution towards understand adversarial training and believe ICLR is an appropriate venue for this work.",,7.0,3.0
1153,True,Adversarial Machine Learning at Scale,"This paper investigate the phenomenon of the adversarial examples and the adversarial training on the dataset of ImageNet. While the final conclusions are still vague, this paper raises several noteworthy finding from its experiments.
The paper is well written and easy to follow. Although I still have some concerns about the paper (see the comments below), this paper has good contributions and worth to publish.

Pros:
For the first time in the literature, this paper proposed the concept of ‘label leaking’. Although its effect only becomes significant when the dataset is large, it should be carefully handled in the future research works along this line.
Using the ratio of 'clean accuracy' over ‘adversarial accuracy’ as the measure of robust is more reasonable compared to the existing works in the literature. 

Cons:
Although the conclusions of the paper are based on the experiments on ImageNet, the title of the paper seems a little misleading. I consider Section 4 as the main contribution of the paper. Note that Section 4.3 and Section 4.4 are not specific to large-scale dataset, thus emphasizing the ‘large-scale’ in the title and in the introduction seems improper. 
Basically all the conclusions of the paper are made based on observing the experimental results. Further tests should have been performed to verify these hypotheses. Without that, the conclusions of the paper seems rushy. For example, one dataset of imageNet can not infer the conclusions for all large-scale datasets. ",,6.0,4.0
1154,False,BIOACOUSTIC SEGMENTATION BY HIERARCHICAL DIRICHLET PROCESS HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL,"The paper is a novel application for the sticky HDP-HMM, focused on correctly identifying the number of components in bird and whale song across a variety of datasets. It's nice to see the model applied to an interesting dataset. My main issues with the paper have to do with structure and the choice of representation used in the model. Namely:

The organization of the paper could be significantly improved. There is a lot of repetitive introduction that adds little to the paper. The first and last two sentences of the abstract could be cut. Many other parts of the abstract basically repeat the introduction. The second paragraph of section 2.3 also repeats your introduction - by now we know what you're doing. I think most people reading this will have no idea what Kershenbaum (2014) is. The description of the data should go in the experiments section. ""Different hypotheses for the songs were emitted"" in the introduction is odd phrasing. Figure 4 should be the first figure and go in the introduction. Figure 5 should be in the methods section. A summary of Table 1 should be in the experiments section. Generally the writing could be tightened quite a bit, which would make space for these figures. The description of the HDP-HMM, which mostly follows the existing literature, is well done.

Some general questions about the methods used:

If you're interested in scalable inference, why use Gibbs sampling? Why not the beam sampler (van Gael 2008), which at least recently was the state of the art for MCMC inference in the HDP-HMM? More generally, why use MCMC at all? For very large datasets, most of the Bayesian ML community has converged on stochastic variational inference as the most practical method (eg Wang, Paisley and Blei 2011).

If your interest is mainly in the number of clusters, how would you address the fact that DP mixture models are known not to be consistent for estimating the true number of clusters (Miller and Harrison 2013)?

MFCC features are calibrated to the human auditory system, not bird or whale auditory systems. In your data, do you calibrate the MFCC scale to be closer to the auditory systems of the animals that generated the song?

And a final suggestion for future work, which could use the results presented here as a baseline:

Given the success of LSTMs in speech recognition in recent years, it may be the case that deep learned representations are superior to linear features (like the means of each cluster in an HDP-HMM) for animal song as well.

Although the technique itself is not novel, the application of this data-driven method to bioacoustics segmentation is quite challenging, and may yield some scientific findings, and this is a valuable contribution to the bioacoustics field. My concern for this paper is that it does not have fair comparison of the other simple methods including BIC and AIC, and it is better to provide such comparisons. Especially, as the authors pointed out, the computational cost of HDP-HMM is a big issue, and the other simple methods may solve this issue.",,5.0,3.0

They provide evidence that this is a difficult task by explaining that there doesn't exist a consensus among human experts on how this should be done.

1157,False,Distributed Transfer Learning for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Basic Probability Assignment,"This paper proposed to use the BPA criterion for classifier ensembles.

My major concern with the paper is that it attempts to mix quite a few concepts together, and as a result, some of the simple notions becomes a bit hard to understand. For example:

(1) ""Distributed"" in this paper basically means classifier ensembles, and has nothing to do with the distributed training or distributed computation mechanism. Granted, one can train these individual classifiers in a distributed fashion but this is not the point of the paper.

(2) The paper uses ""Transfer learning"" in its narrow sense: it basically means fine-tuning the last layer of a pre-trained classifier.

Aside from the concept mixture of the paper, other comments I have about the paper are:

(1) I am not sure how BPA address class inbalance better than simple re-weighting. Essentially, the BPA criteria is putting equal weights on different classes, regardless of the number of training data points each class has. This is a very easy thing to address in conventional training: adding a class-specific weight term to each data point with the value being the inverse of the number of data points will do.

(2) Algorithm 2 is not presented correctly as it implies that test data is used during training, which is not correct: only training and validation dataset should be used. I find the paper's use of ""train/validation"" and ""test"" quite confusing: why ""train/validation"" is always presented together? How to properly distinguish between them?

(3) If I understand correctly, the paper is proposing to compute the BPA in a batch fashion, i.e. BPA can only be computed when running the model over the full train/validation dataset. This contradicts with the stochastic gradient descent that are usually used in deep net training - how does BPA deal with that? I believe that an experimental report on the computation cost and timing is missing.

In general, I find the paper not presented in its clearest form and a number of key definitions ambiguous.",,4.0,4.0

The main problem with this paper is the writing. There are many typos, and the presentation is not clear. For example, the way the training set for weak classifiers are constructed remains unclear to me despite the author's previous answer. I do not buy the explanation about the use of both training and validation sets to compute BPA. Also, I am not convinced non-convexity is a problem here and the author does not provide an ablation study to validate the necessity of separately learning the filters. One last question is CIFAR has three channels and MNIST only one: How it this handled when pairing the datasets in the second set of experiments?

1159,False,Distributed Transfer Learning for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Basic Probability Assignment,"Update: I thank the author for his comments! At this point, the paper is still not suitable for publication, so I'm leaving the rating untouched.

This paper proposes a transfer learning method addressing optimization complexity and class imbalance.

My main concerns are the following:

1. The paper is quite hard to read due to typos, unusual phrasing and loose use of terminology like “distributed”, “transfer learning” (meaning “fine-tuning”), “softmax” (meaning “fully-connected”), “deep learning” (meaning “base neural network”),  etc. I’m still not sure I got all the details of the actual algorithm right.

2. The captions to the figures and tables are not very informative – one has to jump back and forth through the paper to understand what the numbers/images mean.

3. From what I understand, the authors use “conventional transfer learning” to refer to fine-tuning of the fully-connected layers only (I’m judging by Figure 1). In this case, it’s essential to compare the proposed method with regimes when some of the convolutional layers are also updated. This comparison is not present in the paper.

Comments on the pre-review questions:

1. Question 1: If the paper only considers the case |C|==|L|, it would be better to reduce the notation clutter.

2. Question 2: It is still not clear what the authors mean by distributed transfer learning. Figure 1 is supposed to highlight the difference from the conventional approach (fine-tuning of the fully-connected layers; by the way, I don’t think, Softmax is a conventional term for fully-connected layers). From the diagram, it follows that the base CNN has the same number of convolutional filters at every layer and, in order to obtain a distributed ensemble, we need to connect (for some reason) filters with the same indices. This does not make a lot of sense to me but I’m probably misinterpreting the figure. Could the authors revise the diagram to make it clearer?

1160,False,Learning Disentangled Representations in Deep Generative Models,"This paper introduces a variant of the semi-supervised variational auto-encoder (VAE) framework. The authors present a way of introducing structure (observed variables) inside the recognition network.

I find that the presentation of the inference with auxiliary variables could be avoided, as it actually makes the presentation unnecessarily complicated. Specifically, the expressions with auxiliary variables are helpful for devising a unified implementation, but modeling-wise one can get the same model without these auxiliary variables and recover a minimal extension of VAE where part of the generating space is actually observed. The observed variables mean that the posterior needs to also condition on those, so as to incorporate the information they convey. The way this is done in this paper is actually not very different from Kingma et al. 2014, and I am surprised that the experiments show a large deviation in these two methods' results. Given the similarity of the models, it'd be useful if the authors could give a possible explanation on the superiority of their method compared to Kingma et al. 2014. By the way, I was wondering if the experimental setup is the same as in Kingma et al. 2014 for the results of Fig. 5 (bottom) - the authors mention that they use CNNs for feature extraction but from the paper it's not clear if Kingma et al. do the same. 

On a related note, I was wondering the same for the comparison with Jampani et al. 2015. In particular, is that model also using the same rate of supervision for a fair comparison?

The experiment in section 4.3 is interesting and demonstrates a useful property of the approach.

The discussion of the supervision rate (and the pre-review answer) is helpful in giving some insight about what is a successful training protocol to use in semi-supervised learning.

Overall, the paper is interesting but the title and introduction made me expect something more from it. From the title I expected a method for interpreting general deep generative models, instead the described approach was about a semi-supervised variant of VAE - naturally including labelled examples disentangles the latent space, but this is a general property of any semi-supervised probabilistic model and not unique to the approach described here. Moreover, from the intro I expected to see a more general approximation scheme for the variational posterior (similar to Ranganath et al. 2015  which trully allows very flexible distributions), however this is not the case here.

Given the above, the contributions of this paper are in defining a slight variant of the semi-supervised VAE, and (perhaps more importantly) formulating it in a way that is amendable to easier automation in terms of software. But methodologically there is not much contribution to the current literature. The authors mention that they plan to extend the framework in the probabilistic programming setting. It seems indeed that this would be a very promising and useful extension.

1161,False,Learning Disentangled Representations in Deep Generative Models,"This paper investigates deep generative models with multiple stochastic nodes and gives them meaning by semi-supervision. From a methodological point of view, there is nothing fundamentally novel (it is very similar to the semi-supervised work of Kingma et al; although this work has sometimes more than two latent nodes, it is not a complex extension). There is a fairly classical auxiliary variable trick used to make sure the inference network for y is trained over all data points (by supposing y is in fact is a latent variable with an observation \tilde y; the observation is y if y is observed, or uninformative for unobserved y). Alternatively, one can separate the inference used to learn the generative model (which throws out inference over y if it is observed), from an inference used to 'exercise' the model (approximate the complex p(y|x) in the model by a simpler q(y|x) - effectively inferring the target p(y|x) for the data where only x is collected). Results are strong, although on simple datasets. Overall this is a well written, interesting paper, but lacking in terms of methodological advances.

Minor:
- I feel the title is a bit too general for the content of the paper. I personally don't agree with the strong contrast made between deep generative models and graphical models (deep generative models are graphical models, but they are more typically learned and un-interpretable than classical graphical models; and having multiple stochastic variables is not exclusive to graphical models, see DRAW, Deep Kalman Filter, Recurrent VAE, etc.). The word 'structure' is a bit problematic; here, the paper seems more concerned with disentangling and semanticizing the latent representation of a generative model by supervision. It is debatable whether the models themselves have structure.",,6.0,5.0

This variant gives software implementation of these VAE models more flexibility in specifying which variables are supervised and which are not.

This development introduces a few extra terms compared to the original semi-supervised VAE formulation proposed by Kingma et al., 2014.  From the experiment results it seems that these terms do not do much as the new formulation and the performance difference between the proposed method and Kingma et al. 2014 are not very significant (Figure 5).  Therefore the benefit of the new formulation is likely to be just software engineering flexibility and convenience.

This flexibility and convenience is nice to have, but it is better to demonstrate a few situations where the proposed method can be applied while for other previous methods it is non-trivial to do.

The paper's title and the way it is written make me expect a lot more than what is currently in the paper.  I was expecting to see, for example, structured hidden variable model for the posterior (page 4, top), or really ""structured interpretation"" of the generative model (title), but I didn't see any of these.  The main contribution of this paper (a variant of the semi-supervised VAE model) is quite far from these.

Aside from these, the plug-in estimation for discrete variables only works when the function h(x,y) is a continuous function of y.  If however, h(x, y) is not continuous in y, for example h takes one form when y=1 and another form when y=2, then the approach of using Expectation[y] to replace y will not work.  Therefore the ""plug-in"" estimation has its limitations.

1163,True,DeepCoder: Learning to Write Programs,"This paper presents an approach to learn to generate programs. Instead of directly trying to generate the program, the authors propose to train a neural net to estimate a fix set of attributes, which then condition a search procedure. This is an interesting approach, which make sense, as building a generative model of programs is a very complex task.

Faster computation times are shown in the experimental section with respect to baselines including DFS, Enumeration, etc. in a setup with very small programs of length up to 5 instructions have to be found. 
It is not clear to me how the proposed approach scales to larger programs, where perhaps many attributes will be on. Is there still an advantage?

The authors use as metric the time to find a single program, whose execution will result in the set of 5 input-output pairs given as input. However, as mentioned in the paper, one is not after a generic program but after the best program, or a rank list of all programs (or top-k programs) that result in a correct execution.
Could the authors show experiments in this setting? would still be useful to have the proposed approach? what would the challenges be in this more realistic scenario?

In the second experiment the authors show results where the length of the program at training time is different than the length at test time. However, the results are shown when only 20% of the programs are finished. Could you show results for finding all programs? 

The paper is missing an analysis of the results. What type of programs are difficult? how often is the NNet wrong? how does this affect speed? what are the failure modes of the proposed method?

The authors proposed to have a fix-length representation of the each input-output pair, and then use average pooling to get the final representation. However, why would average pooling make sense here? would it make more sense to combine the predictions at the decoder, not the encoder?

Learning from only 5 executions seems very difficult to me. For programs so small it might be ok, but going to more difficult and longer programs this setting does not seem reasonable.

1169,False,Multi-modal Variational Encoder-Decoders,"UPDATE: I have read the authors' rebuttal and also the other comments in this paper's thread. My thoughts have not changed.

The authors propose using a mixture prior rather than a uni-modal
prior for variational auto-encoders. They argue that the simple
uni-modal prior ""hinders the overall expressivity of the learned model
as it cannot possibly capture more complex aspects of the data
distribution.""

I find the motivation of the paper suspicious because while the prior
may be uni-modal, the posterior distribution is certainly not.
Furthermore, a uni-modal distribution on the latent variable space can
certainly still lead to the capturing of complex, multi-modal data
distributions. (As the most trivial case, take the latent variable
space to be a uniform distribution; take the likelihood to be a
point mass given by applying the true data distribution's inverse CDF
to the uniform. Such a model can capture any distribution.)

In addition, multi-modality is arguably an overfocused concept in the
literature, where the (latent variable) space is hardly anymore worth
capturing from a mixture of simple distributions when it is often a
complex nonlinear space. It is unclear from the experiments how much
the influence of the prior's multimodality influences the posterior to
capture more complex phenomena, and whether this is any better than
considering a more complex (but still reparameterizable) distribution
on the latent space.

I recommend that this paper be rejected, and encourage the authors to
more extensively study the effect of different priors.

I'd also like to make two additional comments:

While there is no length restriction at ICLR, the 14 page document can
be significantly condensed without loss of describing their innovation
or clarity. I recommend the authors do so.

Finally, I think it's important to note the controversy in this paper.
It was submitted with many significant incomplete details (e.g., no experiments,
many missing citations, a figure placed inside that was pencilled in

1170,False,Multi-modal Variational Encoder-Decoders,"The authors introduce some new prior and approximate posterior families for variational autoencoders, which are compatible with the reparameterization trick, as well as being capable of expressing multiple modes. They also introduce a gating mechanism between prior and posterior. They show improvements on bag of words document modeling, and dialogue response generation. The original abstract is overly strong in its assertion that a unimodal latent prior p(z) cannot fit a multimodal marginal int_z p(x|z)p(x)dz with a DNN response model p(x|z) (""it cannot possibly capture more complex aspects of the data distribution"", ""critical restriction"", etc).

While the assertion that a unimodal latent prior is necessary to model multimodal observations is false, there are sensible motivations for the piecewise constant prior and posterior. For example, if we think of a VAE as a sort of regularized autoencoder where codes are constrained to ""fill up"" parts of the prior latent space, then there is a sphere-packing argument to be made that filling a Gaussian prior with Gaussian posteriors is a bad use of code space. Although the authors don't explore this much, a hypercube-based tiling of latent code space is a sensible idea.

As stated, I found the message of the paper to be quite sloppy with respect to the concept of ""multi-modality."" There are 3 types of multimodality at play here: multimodality in the observed marginal distribution p(x), which can be captured by any deep latent Gaussian model, multimodality in the prior p(z), which makes sense in some situations (e.g. a model of MNIST digits could have 10 prior modes corresponding to latent codes for each digit class), and multimodality in the posterior z for a given observation x_i, q(z_i|x_i). The final type of multimodality is harder to argue for, except in so far as it allows the expression of flexibly shaped distributions without highly separated modes. I believe flexible posterior approximations are important to enable fine-grained and efficient tiling of latent space, but I don't think these need to have multiple strong modes. I would be interested to see experiments demonstrating otherwise for real world data.

I think this paper should be more clear about the different types of multi-modality and which parts of their analysis demonstrate which ones. I also found it unsatisfactory that the piecewise variable analysis did not show different components of the multi-modal prior corresponding to different words, but rather just a separation between the Gaussian and the piecewise variables.

As I mention in my earlier questions, I found it surprising that the learned variance and mean for the Gaussian prior helps so dramatically with G-NVDM likelihood when the powerful networks transforming to and from latent space should make it scale-invariant. Explicitly separating out the contributions of a reimplemented base model, prior-posterior interpolation and the learned prior parameters would strengthen these experiments. Overall, the very strong improvements on the text modeling task over NVDM seem hard to understand, and I would like to see an ablation analysis of all the differences between that model and the proposed one.

The fact that adding more constant components helps for document modeling is interesting, and it would be nice to see more qualitative analysis of what the prior modes represent. I also would be surprised if posterior modes were highly separated, and if they were it would be interesting to explore if they corresponded to e.g. ambiguous word-senses.

The experiments on dialog modeling are mostly negative results, quantitatively. The observation that the the piecewise constant variables encode time-related words and the Gaussian variables encode sentiment is interesting, especially since it occurs in both sets of experiments. This is actually quite interesting, and I would be interested in seeing analysis of why this is the case. As above, I would like to see an analysis of the sorts of words that are encoded in the different prior modes and whether they correspond to e.g. groups of similar holidays or days.

In conclusion, I think the piecewise constant variational family is a good idea, although it is not well-motivated by the paper. The experimental results are very good for document modeling, but without ablation analysis against the baseline it is hard to see why they should be with such a small modification in G-NVDM. The fact that H-NVDM performs better is interesting, though. This paper should better motivate the need for different types of multi-modality, and demonstrate that those sorts of things are actually being captured by the model. As it is, the paper introduces an interesting variational family and shows that it performs better for some tasks, but the motivation and analysis is not clearly focused. To demonstrate that this is a broadly applicable family, it would also be good to do experiments on a more standard datasets like MNIST. Even without an absolute log-likelihood improvement, if the method yielded interpretable multiple modes this would be a valuable contribution.",,4.0,5.0
1171,False,Multi-modal Variational Encoder-Decoders,"This paper proposes a piecewise constant parameterisation for neural variational models so that it could explore the multi-modality of the latent variables and develop more powerful neural models. 
The experiments of neural variational document models and variational hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder models show that the introduction of the piecewise constant distribution helps achieve better perplexity on modelling documents and seemly better performance on modelling dialogues.
The idea of having a piecewise constant prior for latent variables is interesting, but the paper is not well-written (even 14 pages long) and the design of the experiments fails to demonstrate the most of the claims.  

The detailed comments are as follows:

--The author explains the limitations of the VAEs with standard Gaussian prior in the last paragraph of 3.1 and the last paragraph of 5.1. Hence, a multimodal prior would help the VAEs overcome the issues of optimisation. However, there is a lack of evidence showing the multimodality of the prior helps break the bottleneck. 

--In the last paragraph of 6.1, the author claimed the decoder parameter matrix is directly affected by the latent variables. But what the connects the decoder is a combination of a piecewise constant and Gaussian latent variables. No matter what is discovered in the experiments, it only shows z=",,4.0,4.0

1173,False,NEUROGENESIS-INSPIRED DICTIONARY LEARNING: ONLINE MODEL ADAPTION IN A CHANGING WORLD,"I'd like to thank the authors for their detailed response and clarifications.

This work proposes new training scheme for online sparse dictionary learning. The model assumes a non-stationary flow of the incoming data. The goal (and the challenge) is to learn a model in an online manner in a way that is capable of  adjusting to the new incoming data without forgetting how to represent previously seen data. The proposed approach deals with this problem by incorporating a mechanism for adding or deleting atoms in the dictionary. This procedure is inspired by the adult neurogenesis phenomenon in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. 

The paper has two main innovations over the baseline approach (Mairal et al): (i) “neuronal birth” which represents an adaptive way of increasing the number of atoms in the dictionary (ii) ""neuronal death"", which corresponds to removing “useless” dictionary atoms.

Neural death is implemented by including an group-sparsity regularization to the dictionary atoms themselves (the group corresponds to a column of the dictionary). This promotes to shrink to zero atoms that are not very useful, keeping controlled the increase of the dictionary size.

I believe that the strong side of the paper is its connections with the adult neurogenesis phenomenon, which is, in my opinion a very nice feature.
The paper is very well written and easy to follow.

On the other hand, the overall technique is not very novel. Although not exactly equivalent, similar ideas have been explored. While the neural death is implemente elegantly with a sparsity-promoting regularization term, the neural birth is performed by relying on heuristics that measure how well the dictionary can represent new incoming data. Which depending on the ""level"" of non-stationarity in the incoming data (or presence of outliers) could be difficult to set. Still, having adaptive dictionary size is very interesting.

The authors could also cite some references in model selection literature. In particular, some ideas such as MDL have been used for automatically selecting the dictionary size (I believe this work does not address the online setting, but still its a relevant reference to have). For instance,

1174,False,NEUROGENESIS-INSPIRED DICTIONARY LEARNING: ONLINE MODEL ADAPTION IN A CHANGING WORLD,"The authors propose a simple modification of online dictionary learning: inspired by neurogenesis, they propose to add steps of atom addition, or atom deletion, in order to extent the online dictionary learning algorithm algorithm of Mairal et al. Such extensions helps to adapt the dictionary to changing properties of the data. 

The online adaptation is very interesting, even if it is quite simple. The overall algorithm is quite reasonable, but not always described in sufficient details: for example, the thresholds or conditions for neuronal birth or death are not supported by a strong analysis, even if the resulting algorithm seems to perform well on quite extensive experiments.

The overall idea is nevertheless interesting (even if not completely new), and the paper generally well written and pretty easy to follow. The analysis is however quite minimal: it could have been interesting to study the evolving properties of the dictionary, to analyse its accuracy for following the changes in the data, etc.

1175,False,NEUROGENESIS-INSPIRED DICTIONARY LEARNING: ONLINE MODEL ADAPTION IN A CHANGING WORLD,"The paper is interesting, it relates findings from neurscience and biology to a method for sparse coding that is adaptive and able to automatically generate (or even delete) codes as new data is coming, from a nonstationary distribution.

I have a few points to make:

1. the algorithm could be discussed more, to give a more solid view of the contribution. The technique is not novel in spirit. Codes are added when they are needed, and removed when they dont do much. 

2. Is there a way to relate the organization of the data to the behavior of this method? In this paper, buildings are shown first, and natural images (which are less structured, more difficult) later. Is this just a way to perform curriculum learning? What happens when data simply changes in structure, with no apparent movement from simple to more complex (e.g. from flowers, to birds, to fish, to leaves, to trees etc)

In a way, it makes sense to see an improvement when the training data has such a structure, by going from something artificial and simpler to a more complex, less structured domain.

The paper is interesting, the idea useful with some interesting insights. I am not sure it is ready for publication yet.

1176,False,Combating Deep Reinforcement Learning's Sisyphean Curse with Intrinsic Fear,"This paper addresses an important and timely topic in a creative way. I consider it to have three flaws (and one good idea).

1) insufficient context of what is known and had been studied before (in shallow RL), for example within the field of “robust RL”. A good place to start might be with the work of Shie Mannor.

2) an ill-defined general problem setup. Does it make sense to do post-hoc labeling of certain actions as “catastrophic” if the agent is not informed about that metric during learning? Training a system to do one thing (maximize reward), but then evaluating it with a different metric is misleading. On the training metric, it could even be that the baseline outperforms the new algorithm? So I’d want to see plots for “average reward” in fig 3 as well. Also, what would the baseline learn if it was given large negative rewards for entering these otherwise invisible “danger states”?

3) a somewhat ad-hoc solution, that introduces new domain-specific hyperparameters (k_r, k_lambda and lambda) a second deep network and and two additional replay memories. In terms of results, I’m also unsure whether I can trust the results, given the long-standing track-record of cart-pole being fully solved by many methods: is DQN an outlier here? Or is the convnet not an appropriate function-approximator? Actually: which exact variant “state-of-the-art” variant of DQN are you using?

The good idea that I encourage the authors to pursue further is D_d, this set of rare but dangerous states, that should be kept around in some form. I see it as an ingredient for continual learning that most typical methods lack -- it is also one of the big differences between RL and supervised learning, where such states would generally be discarded as outliers.

Given my comment a couple of weeks ago, and the prompt response (“we implemented expected SARSA”), I would have expected that the paper had been revised with the new results by now? In any case, I’m open to discussing all these points and revising my opinion based on an updated version of the paper.

Minor comment: the bibliography is done sloppily, with missing years, conference venues and missing/misspelled author lists, e.g. “Sergey et al. Levine”. I also think it is good form to cite the actual conference publications instead of arXiv where applicable.",,4.0,4.0
1177,False,Combating Deep Reinforcement Learning's Sisyphean Curse with Intrinsic Fear,"Thanks for an interesting take on an important question :) 
Some high level comments/questions about the issue of ""safety"" in RL:

1. What is the justification that there is any hope of behaving safely when a model is unavailable? Some amount of exploration is needed anyway, and without exploration you are doomed to not find the optimal policy. Essentially you either get stuck with a sub-optimal policy or accept some amount of failures. Whether such failures are acceptable or not is highly application specific, and hence I would encourage the authors to consider a concrete application that has some use (as opposed to toy problems) and provide a reasonable solution tailored to the same. A general solution is unlikely to exist, or be useful in practice.

2. If a model is available, then much of the motivations raised become irrelevant. A simulated car can hit simulated pedestrians many times, and learn from the mistake in simulation -- it does not pose any threat. Further, measures like risk sensitive RL or robust RL can be put in place to ensure sim2real transfer.

3. In light of (2), I would actually encourage the authors to think of their danger model as a form of reward shaping. Can we think of fear as a way to guide the exploration space when a model is made available? That way, the question shifts away from ""safety"" to sample efficiency and transfer. I think the danger model could be a good approach for these considerations (e.g. similar to SARSA). Though these have been mentioned in the paper, I look forward to an expanded discussion along these lines.",,,
1178,False,Combating Deep Reinforcement Learning's Sisyphean Curse with Intrinsic Fear,"- The topic of keeping around highly rewarding or dangerous states is important and has been studied extensively in the RL literature. After the pre-review comments, authors do mention that they compared against expected SARSA but I would really like to see these and other extensive baselines before accepting this paper. 

- There is also an increasing amount of literature of using reward replay buffers in deep RL agents (c.f. Jaderberg, Max, et al. ""Reinforcement learning with unsupervised auxiliary tasks."", Blundell, Charles, et al. ""Model-free episodic control."" , Narasimhan et al. ""Language understanding for text-based games using deep reinforcement learning""), which could perhaps reinforce the agent to avoid revisiting catastrophic states. 

- Overall, the approach presented is not very principled. For instance, why isn't catastrophe directly provided as a signal to the learner instead of a separate model? ",,4.0,3.0
